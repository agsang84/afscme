a. If open vacation slots exist after the initial bid cycle, a second round of vacation bidding will occur. During the second round, employees may place bids for as many one \(1\) week blocks of times as are available. If open vacation slots exist after the second bid cycle, those slots will be utilized at managementâ€™s discretion.

b. If any scheduled vacation weeks are turned in by bargaining unit employees, the institution will place those weeks back out to staff via the following process:

The ISDS Coordinator will send out an email to all security staff announcing the bid vacation week\(s\) returned. Employees will have ten \(10\) days to send a reply email indicating they would like to use that week. At the end of the ten \(10\) days, the employee with the highest state seniority will be awarded the additional week\(s\) of vacation. If no reply emails are received within the ten \(10\) days period, the vacation week can be used by the Employer as it chooses. Full weeks turned in within thirty \(30\) days of the scheduled time off will be used by the Employer as it chooses.

An employee, upon the first day of work after a scheduled bid vacation or scheduled bid vacation in conjunction with trades, will be exempt from the Mandatory Overtime List \(bucket list\).
