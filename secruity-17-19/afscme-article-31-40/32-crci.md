# 32 - CRCI

a. A vacation calendar identifying all vacation periods shall be posted at the end of each business day throughout the annual vacation scheduling process.

b. Annual in-service training periods shall not be established during the months of June through September. Attempts shall be made not to schedule in-service training in May or during school district spring break periods.

c. Annual vacation scheduling shall commence in November and last up to two weeks as determined between Parties. Staff will be notified at least two weeks prior to the annual vacation scheduling process. Notification shall include the specific day and time period in which staff shall submit their bid. Vacation bids become final at the close of the time slot assigned to each individual. Failure to submit a bid as scheduled causes the staff member to lose bidding rights by seniority. These staff may submit vacation requests subsequently for available time periods, but shall not displace any staff who has previously submitted a bid.

d. Security staff will have the option to submit bids for periods not currently available. These will be kept on file \(waiting list\) until such time as the period becomes available.

e. Vacation bids shall be submitted in writing on a bid request sheet. Bids may be done in person or telephonically followed by a written bid request sheet to meet this requirement. The Security Manager shall determine what information shall be included on the bid request sheet.

f. Staff may give back scheduled vacation time anytime up to one \(1\) month prior to their schedule time, unless an emergency occurs. Staff may give back vacation time within one \(1\) month prior to scheduled vacation time, only if the Institution Security Manager or designee accepts the time back.

g. Staff may submit leave requests for vacation periods given back. Requests from staff to fill vacation periods given back must be submitted with sufficient notice to allow the ISDC to complete steps required to adjust rosters, notify staff of job change, etc. Additional vacation/compensatory time may be secured on a first come/first serviced basis throughout the calendar year.

h. Compensatory time shall not be used in the scheduling of annual vacation leave.

i. The planned leave calendar shall be kept current by the Institution Staff Deployment Coordinator \(ISDC\) and posted as changes occur. Staff may request to meet with the ISDC to schedule leave.

j. All requests for leave shall be returned to the requester within ten \(10\) working days and shall be denoted as approved or denied and entered into the Planned Leaves Calendar.

k. If a staff memberâ€™s annual leave accrual is not sufficient to cover the requested time off at the time of the scheduled vacation, they will be required to adjust their leave time accordingly or use leave without pay \(LWOP\).

l. If the provisions of this Agreement are violated by either Party, then the Parties will request a meeting to discuss the issue. Failure to reach an agreement on the dispute shall allow either side to proceed to arbitration under the provision of Article 1, Section 5 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Timelines established in Article 1, Section 5 shall apply to meetings and appeals under this section.
