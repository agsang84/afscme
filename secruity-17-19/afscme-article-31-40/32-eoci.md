# 32 - EOCI

Bidding will occur at the normally scheduled times at EOCI. All annual vacation bid information will be distributed in employee’s mailbox at least fourteen \(14\) calendar days prior to the start of the annual vacation bid process.

If open slots exist after the initial bid cycle, those slots will be available for a second round of bidding by seniority. In this cycle, employees may bid for as many of the remaining vacation slots as the employee wishes to have. If open vacation slots exist after the second bid cycle, those slots may be utilized at management’s discretion.

At the completion of the bidding process, EOCI management will create a waiting list. This list will be created utilizing the following guidelines:

a. Within seven \(7\) days of the completion of the vacation bid process, management will meet with the union and establish a time for the creation of the waiting list.

b. A list of all weeks that were on the original bid will be established.

c. Once the list is created, management will notify all staff that the waiting list will be available for signup on the agreed upon date and time.

d. Staff will be able to place their name \(and up to two \(2\) other people’s request\) on a waiting list for up to three \(3\) weeks that may become available due to staff vacating their bid on a first \(1st\) come basis.

If there are twenty \(20\) or less vacation slots per week, any scheduled vacation slots that are turned in by EOCI security bargaining unit members, the EOCI security employees will have the opportunity to use these vacation slots on the following basis: \(If there are more than twenty \(20\) slots available for a week management may be able to utilize any slots turned back in at their discretion until there are twenty \(20\) slots per week.\)

a. Any week that becomes available, regardless of the reason, will be filled first \(1st\) from the waiting list.

b. If no staff has placed their name on the list for the vacant week, then management will be able to use the week at its discretion.
