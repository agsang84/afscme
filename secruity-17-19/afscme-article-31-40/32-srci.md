If any scheduled vacation weeks are turned in by bargaining unit employees, the bargaining unit employees will have the opportunity to use those vacation weeks via the following process:

a. The ISDS Coordinator will send out an email to all security staff announcing the bid vacation week\(s\) returned. Employees shall have ten \(10\) days to send a reply email indicating they would like to use that week.

b. At the end of the ten \(10\) days, all email replies will be placed into a hat and a lottery draw will occur. The lottery draw will be conducted in the presence of the ISDS Coordinator \(or designee\) and the Local 3940 Union President \(or designee\). If no reply emails are received within the ten \(10\) day period, the vacation week\(s\) can be used by the Institution as it chooses. Week\(s\) turned in within thirty \(30\) days or less of the scheduled time off shall be used by the Institution as it chooses.
