# 32 - Transport

Vacation Bidding will occur on the first Thursday of December each year. The Management team will establish the vacation slots available for the calendar year allowing for required training time for security employees.

a. If open vacation slots exist after the initial bid cycle, those slots will be available for a second round of bidding by seniority. In this cycle, security employees may bid for as many of the remaining vacation slots as the employee wishes to have. This second round of bidding will occur no later than ten \(10\) working days after completion of the first round. Transport will bid by seniority for the second round.

b. Any scheduled vacation slots that are turned in by Transport security bargaining unit members, the Transport security employees will have the opportunity to use these vacation slots on the following basis:

i. All slots turned in will be posted via email to all bargaining unit members.

ii. All email replies will be placed into a hat and a lottery draw will occur.

iii. The use of this vacation time is contingent on the employee having the necessary accrued hours at the time of the requested day off.
