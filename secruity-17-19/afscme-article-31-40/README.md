a. Time spent in actual State service or on military leave, educational leave, or job-incurred disability leave without pay shall be considered as time in the State service in determining length of service for vacation accrual rate.

b. Vacation bidding seniority shall be defined as state service except time spent as a temporary employee. Seniority shall begin on the employee’s date of initial hire into state employment. A break in service is a separation from state service that shall be limited to dismissal, retirement or resignation.

Vacation hours may accumulate to a maximum of three hundred and fifty \(350\) hours. Only three hundred \(300\) hours of vacation may be cashed out upon termination of employment.

### Section 9

Upon reasonable notice to and approval of the Agency, employees shall be permitted to use any portion of, or all of the employees' accrued vacation credits in any segment, except:

b. As provided for set-off of damages or misappropriation of State property or equipment on termination;

c. If the Agency is unable to grant an employee’s specific vacation time off request, the Agency may schedule the employee through mutual agreement who has accrued between three hundred \(300\) hours and three hundred and fifty \(350\) hours to take or make cash payment in lieu of scheduling not to exceed forty \(40\) hours.

d. If two \(2\) or more employees request the same period of time and the matter cannot be resolved by agreement of the Parties concerned, the employee having the greatest length of State service shall be granted the time; however, seniority may be exercised only once in any calendar year.

### Section 13 - Annual Vacation Bidding.

Employees shall select their vacation based upon their seniority in State service with Sergeants, Corporals, and Officers being considered as one \(1\) classification for this purpose.

Except as provided for in Section 14\(e\), during the annual vacation bid process, employees may place bids for as many one \(1\) week blocks of time as they desire. However, employees will not be allowed to bid for vacation slots if they will not have the necessary accrued hours at the time of the requested days off. Those blocks of time requested can be non-consecutive weeks.

The Agency and the Union will work cooperatively where the Agency will rearrange the vacation slots so there is a reasonable amount of additional slots during prime vacationing time.

### Section 14 - Vacation Scheduling.

a. This section shall apply to all functional units.

If an employee reaches the third \(3rd\), tenth \(10th\) or fifteenth \(15th\) year on or prior to December 31st, they shall be allowed to bid the higher number of weeks during that annual bid process for vacations starting on or after January 01. If open slots exist after the initial bid cycle, those slots will be available for a second round of bidding by seniority. During the second round of bidding, employees may bid as many one \(1\) week blocks of time as are available. If open vacation slots exist after the second round of bidding cycle, those slots may be utilized at management’s discretion.

f. The Institution will ensure there will be enough open vacation slots to accomplish the bid. However, the Institution is not obligated to provide a vacation slot for employees who can bid but can not secure any vacant vacation slots because they will not have sufficient accrued vacation or to employees who can not bid on vacant vacation slots because their trial service period has not been completed.

g. Full and partial weeks turned in within thirty \(30\) days of the scheduled time off will be used by the Institution as it chooses.

h. An employee, upon the first day of work after a scheduled bid vacation or scheduled bid vacation in conjunction with trades, will be exempt from the mandatory overtime list \(bucket list\).

## ARTICLE 33 - SICK LEAVE WITH PAY

Sick leave, with pay, shall be determined as follows:

### Section 1

Employees shall accrue eight \(8\) hours of sick leave for each full month worked. Employees working less than a full month but at least thirty-two \(32\) hours shall accrue sick leave on a pro rata basis.

### Section 2

Temporary employees who are subsequently appointed to permanent positions covered by this Agreement, in the same class in which they were employed as a temporary, without a break in service of fifteen \(15\) days or more shall be credited with sick leave from their most recent temporary appointment date.

### Section 3

Whenever an employee accepts an appointment in another agency of State service covered by this Agreement, the employee's accrued sick leave in the former agency shall be assumed by the new employing agency.

### Section 4

Employees who have been separated from the State service and return to a position, except as a temporary, within two \(2\) years shall have unused sick leave hours accrued during previous employment restored.

### Section 5

Actual time worked and all leave with pay, except for educational leave, shall be included in determining the pro rata accrual of sick leave credits each month provided that the employee works thirty-two \(32\) hours or more that month. Employees shall be eligible to utilize sick leave immediately upon accrual.

### Section 6

Employees who have earned sick leave credits shall be eligible for sick leave for any period of absence from employment which is due to the **employee's** illness, bodily injury, disability resulting from pregnancy, necessity for medical or dental care, exposure to contagious disease, attendance upon members of the employee's and their spouse’s or domestic partner’s _**immediate family:**_  

> _parents, wife, husband, children, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, grandchild, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, or another member of the immediate household including the PEBB definition of domestic partners_

where employee's presence is required because of illness or death, in the immediate family of the employee and the employee's spouse, or domestic partner. The Agency has the duty to require that the employee make other arrangements, within a reasonable period of time, for the attendance upon children or other persons in the employee's care. Certification of an attending physician or practitioner may be required by the Agency to support the employee's claim for sick leave, if the employee is absent in excess of seven \(7\) consecutive calendar days, or if the Agency has evidence that the employee is abusing sick leave privileges. The Agency may also require such certificate from an employee to determine whether the employee should be allowed to return to work where the Agency has reason to believe that the employee's return to work would be a health hazard to either the employee or to others. Any cost associated with the supplying of a certificate concerning a job-incurred injury or illness that is not covered by Workers' Compensation benefits shall be borne by the Agency.

### Section 7

If an employee who is not covered by FMLA/OFLA exhausts his/her accrued sick leave hours, but has a need for taking time off on their next regularly scheduled work day due to a situation covered under Section 6 of this Article, shall notify their supervisor according the prescribed method in place that they are taking sick leave time off on their next scheduled work day. Upon return to work, the employee will have a discussion with his/her supervisor if requested and submit a slip and will not be denied the use of any accrued vacation or compensatory time off hours except for valid cause or if the employee is on a prior written notice for attendance problems.

Employees on authorized FMLA/OFLA leave may elect to use leave without pay if they are covered by short or long term disability insurance. Employees not electing to use short or long term disability insurance or employees without that coverage shall use accrued paid leave \(sick leave, vacation leave, compensatory time off\) until such accrued leave is exhausted. Employees may elect to leave or maintain up to forty \(40\) total hours in their sick leave and/or vacation account for use following their return to work or for intermittent FMLA/OFLA usage situations. However, an employee may be approved to leave or maintain up to eighty \(80\) hours of vacation leave to cover preapproved vacation.

Upon exhausting all accrued paid leave, or down to forty \(40\) hours or eighty \(80\) hours for preapproved vacation leave, the employee will be placed on leave without pay until FMLA/OFLA ends. Employees will notify the Agency which paid leave will be used. The employee will be able to choose which specific accrued leave to use in a consecutive block of time and, once selected, the employee must exhaust that particular accrued paid leave amount before being able to use other accrued paid leave. A consecutive block of time shall be either all paid leave in that account \(sick, vacation or compensatory time off\) or the designation of a specified number of hours, not less than forty \(40\) hours. If the employee does not inform the Agency within seven \(7\) days of which type of accrued paid leaves he/she wishes to use, the Agency shall designate the employee to use accrued sick leave consistent with state and federal law until that paid leave is exhausted. Thereafter, the employee may select which accrued paid leave to use if any. If the employee does not have accrued sick leave available, then they will be authorized to request the use of their accrued vacation leave until those hours are exhausted.

### Section 8

Salary paid for a period of sick leave resulting from a condition incurred on the job and also covered by Workers' Compensation, shall be equal to the difference between the Workers' Compensation for lost time and the employee's regular salary rate. In such instances, prorated charges will be made against accrued sick leave.

Should an employee who has exhausted earned sick leave elect to use vacation leave or compensatory time during a period in which Workers' Compensation is being received, the salary paid for such period shall be equal to the difference between the Workers' Compensation for lost time and the employee's regular salary rate. In such instances, prorated charges will be made against accrued vacation leave.

### _**Staff Assaults:**_

#### Subsection 1

An employee who is off duty and on approved Worker’s Compensation time lost because of an inmate committing a Staff Assault regardless of the outcome of the inmate hearing process shall:

1. Continue vacation and sick leave accrual while on time loss. Accrued vacation leave shall not exceed three hundred fifty \(350\) hours. If an employee accrues between two hundred and sixty \(260\) and three hundred \(300\) hours, the Agency shall make a cash payment not to exceed forty \(40\) hours.
2. Where the employee is off work due to a serious physical injury directly inflicted by an inmate and the employee’s attending physician certifies that the employee cannot perform his/her regular duties or modified work, the DOC Director or designee, shall approve the employee to receive supplemental pay in addition to the employee’s worker’s comp benefit which shall be equal to the regular salary rate \(i.e., the step in the salary range at which the employee is paid\) for the first thirty \(30\) days of such leave. The DOC Director or designee, at his/her discretion, may continue approving the employee to receive supplemental pay in addition to the employee’s worker’s comp benefit which shall be equal to the regular salary rate \(i.e., the step in the salary range at which the employee is paid\) for the next one hundred fifty \(150\) days. After the first one hundred eighty \(180\) calendar days of such time loss in any rolling twelve month period, the supplemental pay shall end and the employee shall have the option of sick leave proration use as noted under Section 8. To be approved for this supplemental pay benefit, the employee must have been acting within the course and scope of his/her assignment when assaulted. Time loss resulting from stress related disabilities shall not be eligible for this supplemental benefit. Where the time loss exceeds thirty \(30\) calendar days, the department may require the employee be evaluated by the department’s independent medical examiner to assess the ongoing need for the time off.
3. The Agency will pay up to three \(3\) days of administrative paid leave for the employee following an injury under the following conditions: a. The employee seeks medical care within forty-eight \(48\) hours of being injured or there is a doctor’s certificate the medical treatment was a result of the injury. b. The employee applies for and is approved for workers compensation. The claim must be for a period of less than fourteen \(14\) days. c. The employee’s attending physician certifies that the employee cannot work.

Should the employee’s claim be denied or if the SAIF claim is approved and the employee receives time loss payments for a period of time that lasts fourteen \(14\) or more days then the Agency shall recoup those monies if already paid. The Union may chose to submit the denial to the Agency’s Assistant Director for Human Resources for review and reconsideration.

#### Subsection 2

The Agency shall notify the Local President of all instances of an employee being injured during an inmate staff assault which may qualify for time loss. Methods of notification shall be arranged at each facility’s labor/management committee.

### Section 9 - Hardship Leave

The Agency will allow employees to make irrevocable donations of accumulated vacation leave to a co-worker who has exhausted accumulated leave while recuperating from an extended illness or injury or attending an immediate family member suffering from illness or injury. Hardship leave donations will be administered under the following stipulations and the terms of this Agreement shall be strictly enforced with no exceptions.

f. Donations shall be credited at the recipient's current regular hourly rate of pay. Donations shall be in amounts of no less than two \(2\) hours. In FMLA situations, the Agency will continue to pay for the employee’s health insurance contribution until the employee’s qualifying FMLA period ends. Donees will be allowed to keep forty \(40\) hours of donated leave for future use after they return to work. All other unused donated leave will be returned to donors per Agency policy.

g. Employees otherwise eligible for or receiving workers compensation or on parental leave will not be considered eligible to receive donations under this Agreement.

h. Time spent by the recipient on donated hardship leave shall not count toward completion of the employee’s initial trial service period, nor towards salary eligibility dates for a step increase. When the recipient is released to return to duty, the end of the initial trial service and salary eligibility date will be adjusted by the period of the donated hardship leave taken.

### Section 10

If, while performing assigned duties during his/her assigned shift, the employee has an on the job injury, and such injury requires immediate medical treatment, the employee will not be required to use accrued sick leave while obtaining medical treatment. Once immediate medical treatment is completed, the employee will immediately return to work to complete his/her assigned shift, or, shall become subject to the workers compensation regulations.

Failure to return to work or supply a certificate within five \(5\) days of delivery or attempted delivery shall be deemed a voluntary resignation. However, such absence may be covered by a subsequent grant of leave with or without pay when extenuating circumstances exist.
