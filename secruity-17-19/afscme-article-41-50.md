## ARTICLE 43 - JOB SHARING

### Section 1

"Job sharing position" means a full-time position in the classified service that may be held by more than one \(1\) individual on a shared time basis whereby the individuals holding the position work less than full-time.

### Section 2

Job sharing is a voluntary program. Any employee who wishes to participate in job sharing may submit a written request to the Functional Unit Manager to be considered for job share positions. The Functional Unit Manager shall determine if job sharing is appropriate for a specific position and will recruit and select employees for job share positions. Where the Functional Unit Manager determines job sharing is appropriate, the management agrees to provide written notification to all job share applicants of available job share positions in their office in the Agency.

### Section 3

Job share employees shall accrue vacation leave, sick leave and holiday pay based on a pro rate of hours worked in a month during which the employee has worked thirty-two \(32\) hours or more. Individual salary review dates will be established for job share employees.

### Section 4

Job sharing employees shall be entitled to share the full Agency paid insurance benefits for one \(1\) full-time position based on a pro rate of regular hours scheduled per week or per month whatever is appropriate. In any event, the Agency contribution for insurance benefits in a job share position is limited to the amount authorized for one \(1\) full-time employee. Each job share employee shall have the right to pay the difference between the Agency paid insurance benefits and the full premium amount through payroll deduction.

### Section 5

For purpose of layoff, individuals filling a job share position which totals a full-time equivalent shall be considered as part-time employees at the time the position has been affected by a layoff.

### Section 6

If a vacancy exists and if the Functional Unit Manager determines that job sharing is not appropriate for the position or if the Functional Unit Manager performs a recruitment and is unable to hire qualified employees for the job share position, the remaining employee shall have the right to assume the position on a full-time basis. Upon approval of the Functional Unit Manager, the remaining employee may elect to transfer to a vacant part-time position in the same classification or to voluntarily demote. If the above conditions are not available or acceptable to the employee, the employee agrees to resign.

## ARTICLE 44 - LAYOFF PROCEDURE

### Section 1

When the Agency declares that a lack of funds necessitates a layoff, the Parties will meet, at the request of either Party, to consider alternatives to layoffs such as: voluntary reduction of hours, voluntary paid leave of absence, other voluntary programs and/or temporary interruptions of employment. Such alternatives shall be subject to mutual agreement of the Parties. In the absence of such mutual agreement, the Agency may implement layoff procedures consistent with this Agreement. The Parties agree all discussions that take place under this section are not bargaining and do not require the use of dispute resolution procedures contained in the PECBA.

A layoff is defined as a separation from service for involuntary reasons not reflecting discredit on an employee. An employee shall be given written notice of a pending layoff at least fifteen \(15\) days before the effective date stating the reason for the layoff.

### Section 2

Employees shall be laid off and service credits calculated within the following mutually exclusive categories:

a. Full-time,

b. Part-time \(including job share\).

### Section 3

a. Layoff shall be by classification and geographic as defined in Section 11 of this article. The affected geographic area, functional units and classifications shall be identified by the Agency and provided to the Union thirty \(30\) days prior to the layoff being declared. Order of layoff within the designated classification, functional unit, and geographic area shall be determined by identifying the required number of positions with the lowest service credit.

1. Effective upon layoff, the Agency will terminate temporary employees who are filling vacant positions in the affected classification and functional unit and include those vacant positions as available zero service credit positions during the process in Section 5 of this article. Temporary employees who are backfilling employees on long term leave may be displaced by full time employees who are laid off and elect to accept temporary employment. Full time employees who are on Job Rotation or Work Out of Classification assignments behind vacant positions will be returned to their permanent position if another employee exercises their option in lieu of layoff to the vacant position which would be designated as having zero service credits. If full time employees are backfilling another person on long term leave then the original employee’s service credits shall apply to the position.
2. Prior to implementing layoffs, the Agency will notify all employees in the affected geographic area of the impending layoffs and solicit volunteers to elect to be laid off; volunteers will be solicited in numbers equal to those positions being laid off by classification. If more employees in a specific classification volunteer than are required, layoff will be granted by seniority with the higher seniority prevailing.
3. Employees laid off in a specific section or program within one or more functional units shall be notified fifteen \(15\) days prior to the date designated to declare options in lieu of layoff under Section 5 of this article. Simultaneously, the Agency will notify an equivalent number of least service credit employees in the same classification at that worksite of the potential they may be bumped and should begin exploring possible options in lieu of layoff applicable under Section 5 of this article.
4. If the Agency is ‘deactivating’ or closing a functional unit it shall notify all employees within that functional unit thirty \(30\) days prior to the date designated to declare options in lieu of layoff under Section 5 of this article. Simultaneously, the Agency will notify an equivalent number of least service credit employees in the same classifications within the Geographic Area of the potential they may be bumped and should begin exploring possible options in lieu of layoff as may or may not be applicable under Section 5 of this Article.
5. All impacted employees will be given an opportunity to meet with the Agency and Union and will be provided information regarding the layoff process and their rights including but not limited to: a copy of this Article, an explanation of their options in lieu of layoff, the specifics of the layoff and recall process, various options when applying for the layoff list, other information regarding the administration of the lists, unemployment and other relevant subjects.

b. If an employee is underfilling a position, the employee will be considered in the higher classification for the purposes of this Article.

c. If it is found that two \(2\) or more employees in the Agency in which the layoff is to be made have equal service credits, the order of layoff shall be in inverse order of the greatest length of continuous State service.

d. If ties between employees still exist, the order of layoff shall be determined by using a lottery process as a final tie breaker to determine the order of layoff. The lottery process will include the following elements:

1. Agency and Union representatives will be present to witness the lottery process.
2. A double blind selection process will be used. There will be one container with employee names and another container with the number of employees in the first container or drawn at that time.
3. Simultaneously, one \(1\) representative shall pull names and another representative will pull numbers.
4. Service credit score ties broken through this double blind process shall result in employees being added to the layoff list in inverse order from one \(1\) through the last number drawn.
5. The results of the above lottery process shall also be used to determine the order of recall from the layoff list for those employees.

### Section 4 - Service Credit

a. Service credit score is defined as total length of continuous Agency service. Leave without pay shall not be considered a separation from Agency or bargaining unit service. One \(1\) point shall be allowed for each full month of unbroken service. An employee's seniority shall be computed from the date of the employee's employment by the Agency in any capacity within the Division/Department, except that a new employee shall be on trial service for the appropriate period. A new employee shall be placed on the seniority list and given seniority ratings as of the first day the employee was hired by the Agency.

b. Agency time considered to establish an employee’s service credit score shall be forfeited if an employee has a break in service from the Agency of more than one hundred eighty \(180\) calendar days, other than layoff, or fails to respond within five \(5\) consecutive work days after receiving notice by registered letter mailed to the last address on the Agency's records, unless prevented from responding by conditions beyond the employee's control. An employee who separates from the Agency for one hundred and eighty \(180\) calendar days or less and returns to the Agency shall retain his/her previously accrued Agency time, minus the time the employee was not an employee of the Agency. Agency time considered to establish an employee’s service credit score shall be forfeited if a member of management service returns to the AFSCME Security bargaining unit after one \(1\) year.

c. A Seniority Report shall be prepared by the Agency, during January, updated periodically, and posted on bulletin boards in the Agency. Time with the Board of Parole and the Department of Corrections shall be interchangeable. Time spent by former employees of the EOH&TC who were employed at that facility and transferred to EOCI within six \(6\) months of EOH&TC's closure, shall count toward the calculation of Department of Corrections seniority in that geographic area only.

### Section 5 - Options in Lieu of Layoff

Any employee who is given notice of layoff may file a written request to exercise an option in lieu of layoff with the Appointing Authority within five \(5\) work days of receipt of such notice. Options in lieu of layoff available to each employee shall be dependent on the employee’s service credit score. Starting with the highest service credit score employee in the highest classification identified. The employee's options shall include one \(1\) of the following:

a. Displace one \(1\) of the least service credit positions in the worksite of the same classification.

b. Displace one \(1\) of the least service credit position in the geographic area in the same classification.

c. Demote within the functional unit to a lower classification for which the employee held and/or is qualified, if a position exists which is not already identified for layoff and where the incumbent has the least seniority.

d. If no such option exists within the functional unit, the employee may elect to demote to displace the least service credit score position in the geographic area in a lower classification for which the employee is qualified.

e. If all of the above options have been exhausted an employee may voluntarily accept or reject vacant positions in the other geographic area in the same or lower classification. If they accept the vacant position they will not be placed on the layoff list but will be maintained on the relocation list as pertains to sub section g of this section.

f. Any employee identified by the Agency for layoff may elect to voluntarily accept layoff instead of exercising any of the above options.

g. Any employee who relocates or chooses to be laid off as a result of exercising his/her options in lieu of layoff because of a facility ‘deactivation’ or closure shall have his/her choice of having a first right of return, in service credit order, should the facility reopen. This subsection supersedes the use of recall lists and other methods to fill vacancies until such time as the list of those employees who wish to return to the reopened facility has been exhausted.

### Section 6

The name of a demoting employee shall then be placed on the appropriate layoff list for the class the employee demoted from. Any employee demoted in lieu of layoff may request at that time and shall be paid for all accrued compensatory time at the rate being earned prior to demotion in lieu of layoff.

### Section 7

If an employee's selection in Section 6 results requires moving, moving expenses shall be assumed by the employee.

### Section 8 - Layoff List

a. The layoff list shall be generated by having all employees laid off arranged on the layoff list by service credit score in classification and geographic area from the highest service credit score to the lowest service credit score.

b. As vacant permanent positions the Agency intends to fill become available in geographic area and in the classifications subject to layoffs, the Agency will notify the highest service credit score employee on the layoff list and offer the opportunity for recall. If that employee declines, he/she shall remain on the list and the permanent position and opportunity for recall shall be offered to the next employee on the layoff list until all employees on the layoff list have been offered recall. If no employee accepts recall for an available vacant permanent position, then the Agency can fill the position through other means.

1. Exception for vacancies in the Transport Unit, while a layoff list is active, will be filled by the normal Transport hiring or lateral process and the resultant vacancy – if within the geographic region and bargaining unit – will be made available to the return from layoff list process above.

c. This process will occur for each vacant permanent position the Agency intends to fill and reoccur until the layoff list is exhausted. If more than one position is available at the same time at different functional units, the highest service credit score employee on the list shall have his/her choice of location for recall.

d. Following the use of the injured workers’ list, the Agency shall use the layoff list to fill any permanent vacancies. If no laid off employees accept recall for the available vacancy, the Agency can fill the position through other means. After the layoff process is completed, should an employee voluntarily leave the security bargaining unit, the employee will lose all layoff recall rights. This section only applies during the period when the employee would have been eligible for recall from the layoff list. The Agency shall provide an employee leaving the bargaining unit under the circumstances described above written notice previously reviewed and approved by the Union, that the employee forfeits his/her layoff recall rights.

e. Names shall be maintained on the appropriate layoff list\(s\) for two \(2\) years from the effective date of layoff.

### Section 9

Unclassified, exempt and management service employees shall be restored into classified service pursuant to ORS 240.570. If a reduction in force is required in connection with this return it will be accomplished through this Article. Seniority for the purposes of restoration shall be as defined in Section 4. There shall be no cross-bumping between management service and the bargaining unit.

### Section 10

If the Agency is willing to allow cross bumping between unions, discussion with affected union representatives will be initiated. If the Parties agree, cross bumping will be allowed both ways.

### Section 11 - Geographic Area and Functional Unit

For the purposes of this Article the two \(2\) geographic areas are defined as the area west of Cascade Mountain Range and the area east of the Cascade Mountain Range.

**Functional unit is defined as:**

Each institution - Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution \(EOCI\), Oregon State Penitentiary Minimum \(OSPM\), Santiam Correctional Institution \(SCI\), Shutter Creek Correctional Institution \(SCCI\), Snake River Correctional Institution \(SRCI\), Columbia River Correctional Institution \(CRCI\), Powder River Correctional Facility \(PRCF\), Coffee Creek Correctional Facility, Transportation East and Transportation West and Two Rivers Correctional Institution \(TRCI\), Deer Ridge Correctional Institution \(DRCI\), and Warner Creek Correctional Facility \(WCCF\).

### Section 12 - Temporary Interruption of Employment

When work is not available due to a temporary situation beyond the Agency's control, employees in the affected work unit may have their employment temporarily interrupted for up to fifteen \(15\) calendar days without this being considered a formal layoff under this Article. Temporary workload fluctuations will not be considered as justification for invoking this provision.

Should such a temporary interruption of employment occur, employees so affected will be allowed to use any form of accrued paid leave including vacation, compensatory time off, or personal leave or will be placed on leave without pay where the affected employee\(s\) have insufficient compensatory time to cover the period of interruption.

If limited work is available within the affected work unit, it will be offered to employees by seniority, within the affected classifications, during the period of the temporary interruption provided that if current seniority scores are available, those scores shall be utilized and if special skills are needed, this section shall not apply.

## ARTICLE 45 - REVIEW OF CLASSIFICATION SERIES

### Section 1

It is agreed and understood that procedures for establishing new proposed classifications and for material revision of existing classifications will provide reasonable opportunity for review and input by the Union prior to implementation.

### Section 2

## ARTICLE 46 - RECLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE

> _**The Parties shall use the following procedure to process reclassification requests.**_

### Section 1

The Agency shall furnish Class Specifications and/or current position description at the request of the Union or employee.

### Section 2

The employee will submit a completed official Position Description Form signed by the appointing authority and a written explanation for the proposed reclassification request to the Agency Personnel Officer and a copy mailed to the Union.

### Section 3

The Agency shall conduct a classification audit and review the merits of the request. Within sixty \(60\) days after receipt of reclassification request the Agency shall notify the Union of its decision. The Union shall have an opportunity, before the sixty \(60\) days decision date, to meet with the Agency to present arguments and recommendations where there are objections to the proposed reclassification. The Parties may extend the time limits by mutual, written agreement in those instances where the review process or other extenuating circumstances require additional time for analysis.

### Section 4

Any employee who is involuntarily reclassified or any employee whose reclassification request is denied may take the matter up using the following procedures and standards:

a. Reclassification must be based on findings that the purpose of the position is consistent with the concept of the proposed classification and that the class specifications for the proposed classification more accurately depicts the overall assigned duties, authority and responsibilities of the position. The purpose of the position shall be determined by the statement of purpose and assigned duties of the position description and other relevant evidence of duties assigned by the Agency. The concept of the proposed classification shall be determined by the general description and distinguishing features of its class specification. The overall duties, authority and responsibilities of the position shall be determined by the position description and other relevant evidence of duties assigned by the Agency.

b. If an employee’s reclassification request is denied or if the Agency reclassifies an employee’s position, the Union may appeal the Agency’s decision in writing to the Department of Administrative Services Labor Relations Unit within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of receipt of the written denial and request the Classification Appeal Committee to review the denied request/Agency action. All appeals must be supported with copies of documents originally provided to the Agency for the reclassification request, including written explanation of the request and all relevant documentation. No new documentation or information will be considered by the Committee unless mutually agreed.

c. The Committee shall be composed of one \(1\) Employer representative and one \(1\) Union staff representative. The Committee’s sole mission will be to consider appeals pursuant to this section of the Article and make decisions which maintain the integrity of the classification system by correctly applying the classification specifications. Each representative shall have experience making classification decisions. Additionally, the Committee may use two \(2\) resource persons, one designated by each party to provide technical expertise concerning a specific classification series.

d. The Committee will attempt to resolve the appeal by jointly determining whether the current or another classification more accurately depicts the overall assigned duties, authorities and responsibilities of the position. In this process the Committee shall review the employee’s requested classification and the employee’s current classification. The Committee shall discuss and resolve which classification most accurately depicts the purpose of the job and overall assigned duties. In this process, each Party may also identify one \(1\) alternate class that each Party determines most accurately depicts the purpose of the position and overall assigned duties. In the event the Committee agrees that the position is correctly classified, then the final decision is final and binding. In the event the Committee concludes that the proposed or alternate classification is more appropriate, the Agency retains the right to modify the duties on a timely basis to make it consistent with the previous classification. If the finding of the Committee determines the assigned duties are appropriately classified at a higher salary range, and the Agency subsequently removes the higher level duties, the employee will be compensated work out of class pay from the date of filing the reclassification appeal to the date the duties are removed.

e. If an alternate class is identified, both the Department of Administrative Services and the Union shall be notified. If the Parties agree on the alternate class, that shall end the appeal. The Committee will prepare a written decision to the Agency and Union within sixty \(60\) calendar days of receipt of the appeal by the Committee which will include the reasons for the decision regardless of what the Committee decides. The decision shall be binding on all Parties. However, the Agency may elect to remove or modify duties at any point during the process.

f. If there is no resolution, the Union may request arbitration in writing within fifteen \(15\) calendar days from the date of receipt of the Committee’s final written decision. The Union’s request must be sent to the Department of Administrative Services Labor Relations Unit and shall include the reasons why the Agency’s decision is incorrect.

g. The arbitrator shall allow the Agency’s decision to stand unless he/she concludes that the proposed classification more accurately depicts the overall assigned duties, authority and responsibilities using the criteria stated in subsection \(a\) of this Section. The arbitrator shall issue an award within thirty \(30\) calendar days from the close of hearing. The cost for the arbitrator shall be consistent with Article 51 \(Grievance Procedure\). In the event the arbitrator finds in favor of the proposed or alternate classification, Agency management retains the right to, on a timely basis, adjust duties consistent with its current classification.

h. This section replaces [**Article 51 \(Grievance Procedure\)** ](afscme-article-51-56.md)on the subject of the review of denied reclassification requests or where the Agency has involuntarily reclassified an employee’s position.

### Section 5

Should the duties of the position support the proposed reclassification, the Agency shall make the determination whether to seek legislative approval for reclassification or remove the duties. If a reclassification request, as approved, does not receive the necessary legislative approval required by ORS 291.371, the Agency shall immediately change the duties of the employee to conform to the prior classification.

### Section 6

The effective date of a reclassification implemented under this Article shall be the first of the month following the month in which the reclassification request was received by the Agency.

### Section 7

Any employee reclassified downward will move into the new range at the step that is nearest the employee's current rate. The employee's anniversary date shall remain the same. If the employee's rate is above the highest step in the lower range, the employee shall receive no reduction in pay. Similarly, such employee shall not receive future salary adjustments until such time as the new range encompasses the employee's salary. At this time, the employee shall have a salary adjustment to the nearest step in the range. The employee shall also be placed on the Layoff List for the previously held classification.

### Section 8 - Reclassification Upward

Upon the request of any employee who is called to an investigatory meeting or a meeting which may result in discipline being imposed upon the employee, the employee shall be entitled to the presence of a Union Representative. Should an employee be demoted or discharged by the Agency, a Union Representative will be made aware of the action and allowed to be present prior to the Agency talking to the employee. Should the employee not desire Union representation at the meeting, the employee may request the Union Representative leave prior to the start of the meeting.

### Section 6

A Union Representative shall have the right to discuss with appropriate management staff any disciplinary action imposed, at the affected employee's written request, with or without the employee's presence.

### Section 7

If the Agency places an employee on administrative leave with pay pending completion of an investigation, the employee shall not receive shift or weekend differential if the employee is placed on a day shift with Monday-Friday schedule. If the Agency does not impose serious discipline which involves economic sanctions and returns the employee to work, the Agency shall reimburse the employee for the shift and weekend differential they would have received had they not been placed on administrative leave with pay.
