## ARTICLE 51 - GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION

### Section 1

Grievances are defined as acts, omissions, applications or interpretations alleged to be violations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Employees shall meet with the immediate supervisor informally. If such problems cannot be resolved, the employee may avail themselves of the following procedure. A grievance shall not be expanded upon after the grievance has been filed with the Agency Head.

### Section 2

Dismissal appeals are subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure pursuant to the expedited procedures described in [**Article 50, Discipline and Discharge**](afscme-article-41-50.md#article-50-discipline-and-discharge). All other disciplinary actions and refusal/withholding of merit step increases shall follow the steps outlined in this article.

### Step 1

The employee and/or Union Representative will contact their section manager or designee to meet and discuss alleged contract violations prior to filing a written grievance at Step 2.

### Step 2

If the issue is unresolved, the Union will submit a written grievance containing the date of occurrence, the act or omission that created the grievance, the Section violated, and the remedy desired within thirty \(30\) days of the alleged occurrence to the designated appointing authority. The designated appointing authority’s response shall be due in writing within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of receipt of the grievance.

### Step 3

If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the Union may request review of the grievance by the Labor Relations Administrator or designee within fifteen \(15\) days after receiving the response from Step 2. A response from the Labor Relations Administrator or designee shall be given within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of the Union’s appeal to step 3, unless otherwise agreed to in writing.

### Step 4

If the grievance is not resolved by the Agency, the Union shall notify the Labor Relations Unit of the Department of Administrative Services in writing within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of receipt of the designated appointing authority’s response that such response is not acceptable. For purposes of this Article, an appeal in writing can be delivered by first class registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, by fax or by electronic mail to the Labor Relations Unit email address \([LRU@oregon.gov](mailto:LRU@oregon.gov)\). A meeting will be held between the Parties to mutually share information about the grievance. The Parties shall discuss their respective positions known at the time and may discuss options for resolution.

The Labor Relations Unit shall respond in writing to the grievance within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of receipt of the grievance.

### Step 5

If the grievance is not resolved at the Labor Relations Unit within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of the Step 4 notice or as otherwise mutually agreed to in writing, the Union shall notify the Department of Administrative Services in writing that it desires arbitration of the grievance. Either party may request from the Employment Relations Board a list of nine \(9\) qualified arbitrators. Whomever sends the arbitration request to the Employment Relations Board will send a copy of request letter to the other party. Within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of receipt of the Employment Relations Board list of arbitrators or upon mutual agreement, the parties shall select an arbitrator. Selection of an arbitrator shall start with a flip of a coin. The party that loses the flip of the coin will strike the first \(1st\) name from the list. Each party shall thereafter alternatively strike names until a final arbitrator remains. The arbitrator selected will hear the case pursuant to Section 3 of this Article.

### Section 3 - Arbitrations

a. The Employer or Union shall send a letter to the arbitrator selected for the hearing. The letter shall include the request for a list of potential dates including the three month period beginning the second full month after receipt of the notice of intent to arbitrate. When the arbitrator originally selected is unable to schedule a hearing within the three \(3\) month period, the parties may request from the Employment Relations Board a new list of arbitrators. In cases where the Parties agree to consolidate cases, the arbitrator assigned to handle the first case will also be assigned to handle the other case\(s\).

b. Arbitrators will use cancellation days and any unused scheduled days for writing awards on any outstanding cases under this agreement. Cancellation fees will be applied toward any writing days.

### Section 4

The Parties agree that the decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on each of the Parties and that they will abide thereby. The Parties do not waive any right of review provided by law. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to or subtract from or change any of the terms of the Agreement, except for salaries on new classifications. The arbitrator's award shall be due to the Parties within thirty \(30\) days of the close of the hearing.

### Section 5

The arbitrator's fees and expenses shall be paid by the losing party. If, in the opinion of the arbitrator, neither party can be considered the losing party, then such fees and expenses shall be divided as in the arbitrator’s judgment is equitable. All other expenses shall be borne exclusively by the party requiring the service or item for which payment is to be made.

### Section 6

Grievances shall be reduced to writing and submitted on the form identified as an AFSCME Grievance Form.

### Section 7

Time limits specified in this procedure must be observed unless either party requests a specific extension of time which, if agreed to, shall be stipulated in writing and shall become part of the grievance record. If management fails to issue a response within the time limits set forth in this Article, the grievance may be advanced to the next step of the grievance procedure.

### Section 8

Subsequent to an arbitration request and prior to the assignment of an arbitrator, mediation may be scheduled and conducted by the Employment Relations Board Conciliation Service if both Parties agree. Mediation is not a mandatory step in the grievance procedure.

### Section 9

Group grievances filed by the Union that cover two \(2\) or more bargaining unit employees at a specific institution shall be filed at step 1 of the grievance procedure. Group grievances filed by the Union that cover all bargaining unit employees shall be filed at step 3 of the grievance procedure, provided that the grievance may be deemed timely filed if the Union obtains proof of submission to a superintendent or designee.

### Section 10 - Expedited Arbitration

a. Upon mutual agreement, the Employer and Union may agree to use this expedited procedure in this section of the article to hear a grievance. The procedure outlined in this section will not be used for dismissals, statewide group grievances and grievances with issues of arbitrability.

## ARTICLE 55 - FIRE ASSIGNMENTS

### Section 1

Each year, the Agency will notify employees of the opportunity to volunteer for firefighting, fire camp support and other fire related activities in advance and in writing.

If an agreement cannot be reached, the Agency will select from a list of qualified volunteers based upon bargaining unit seniority.

### Section 2

Fire camp and fire crew duties are voluntary assignments, and by volunteering, the employees agree to deviate from normal work schedules without any shift changes penalty to the Agency. These assignments may include long hours in outdoor settings far from the employee’s designated institution.

### Section 3

Staffing requirements will vary depending upon the needs of the outside Agencies that contract with the Agency for fire related services.

### Section 4

Employees who are required to wear fire line Agency approved boots shall have their choice of being issued boots that meet applicable safety standards or receive $150.00 to put toward the purchase of boots that meet applicable safety standards to be used for DOC related work.

Employees choosing to receive boots from the Agency will work with their institution safety manager prior to fire assignment to receive a pair of boots that meet applicable safety standards and which will be used for Agency related work only. If at any time the Agency issued boots are damaged or have excessive wear, the institution safety manager shall replace or repair the boots.

Employees receiving the $150.00 must meet with the institution’s safety officer at the end of and/or the beginning of the fire season to determine if the boots meet the applicable safety standards or need to be repaired or replaced. If the boots are determined to be in need of repair, the employee may opt to have the Agency repair the boots at the Agency’s expense, receive $150.00 from the Agency and purchase new boots, or receive boots from the Agency.

### Section 5

A fire assignment is defined as the time period from activation until the employee returns to their functional unit and completes assigned deactivation duties.

#### a. Fire Assignment Work Schedule

Employees shall have a work schedule of sixteen \(16\) hours on and eight \(8\) hours off each day except on the day of deployment, the day demobilization and where authorized by the Agencies contract with the Oregon Department of Forestry.

Unless there is an: a\) emergency, b\) the need to accomplish immediate / critical fire suppression objectives, c\) address immediate and critical firefighter or public safety objectives, or d\) during initial deployment, initial attack, or deactivation, employees shall not normally work more than sixteen \(16\) hours in a twenty four \(24\) hour period.

#### b. Length of Assignment

Standard assignment is up to fourteen \(14\) days or less exclusive of travel to and from the institution. Travel time to and from the incident shall be considered time worked. The length of the assignment is unknown at the time of the placement of the resource order and days and hours worked are not guaranteed.

#### c. Days Off

Employees returning from fire assignments that have worked less than seven \(7\) days total, but have worked more than twelve \(12\) consecutive hours on the day of their return, will have a minimum eight \(8\) hours of rest between their fire assignment and the beginning of their next regularly scheduled shift at the institution. Administrative leave will be provided to the employee for any portion of the eight \(8\) hour rest period that falls during the employee’s regularly scheduled shift. Administrative Leave is not applicable for those employees not scheduled to work within the twenty-four \(24\) hour period upon their return.

Employees returning from fire assignments that have worked consecutively for seven \(7\) to thirteen \(13\) days will receive a twenty-four \(24\) hour rest period upon return to their functional unit and completion of deactivation duties. Administrative Leave will cover any portion of an employee’s remaining shift during this twenty-four \(24\) hour period. Upon written request and barring any compelling reason, employees may take accrued leave for time off beyond the twenty-four \(24\) hour rest period that would result in the completion of their next regularly scheduled work shift at the institution. Administrative Leave is not applicable for those employees not scheduled to work within the twenty-four \(24\) hour period upon their return.

Employees who have been on assignment fourteen \(14\) consecutive days or more, and who request it, will be permitted to utilize one day of accrued vacation leave in addition to administrative leave before returning to their normal work schedule.

#### d. Extension of Assignments.

Upon completion of the standard fourteen \(14\) day assignment, an employee may request an extension of up to seven \(7\) days if allowed by local labor / management agreement, and upon the approval of the Superintendent or his / her designee.

Assignment may be extended up to an additional seven \(7\) days beyond the twenty one \(21\) day period by local labor / management agreement, at the request of the employee, and approval of the Superintendent or his / her designee.

However, if the employee is to remain on the fire assignment, the employee must immediately be scheduled two \(2\) days off using accrued leave \(except sick leave\), or at the employee’s option, unpaid leave, prior to the 22nd day of the work assignment. Days off will be away from the fire camp with transportation provided back to the institution by the Agency. The decision where to take the mandatory days off will be made between the employee and the Superintendent or his / her designee with the intention that the employee’s first option will be returning home.

In unusual circumstances where events and/or situations require the employee to remain geographically proximal to the fire assignment, lodging and per diem will be provided by the Agency.

### Section 6

When employees are deployed on fire assignment where inmates are provided meals, employees shall receive at least the same number of meals as the inmates, free of charge. After initial deployment, meals will be provided based upon resource orders from the Department of Forestry’s dispatching office to an institution or by way of agreement between the Department of Corrections and the Department of Forestry for the provision of these services. On the extended fire assignments, the DOC or the contracting agencies will ensure that sufficient meals are provided to employees.

### Section 7

Employees who are off duty on forest fire assignments shall be considered on call unless the Agency notifies the employee otherwise, per [**Article 19, Section 8** ](afscme-article-51-56.md)of the contract. However, forest fire assignments are voluntary and an employee is not guaranteed on call pay solely by virtue of their working on fire assignments, but will be entitled to on call pay only when they are so designated, or if they meet the criteria outlined in [**Article 19, Section 2**](afscme-article-51-56.md).

### Section 8

Notification of on call status shall be provided for through the fire camp roster if such a roster exists. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to check the roster on a daily basis. If the fire camp does not have a daily roster or a camp commander, then the senior employee will make every reasonable effort to check with their respective institution fire camp manager / designee prior to assigning an employee to on call status.

### Section 9

On call time will be distributed evenly and equitably to employees regardless of bargaining unit.

### Section 10

Department employees may be permitted to utilize state-owned vehicles \(DOC or ODOF\) when available and to the extent that use does not compromise the operation of the fire camp or fire crews for use during non-work hours if such use is consistent with policies outlined by the Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Corrections or the Department of Forestry.

While performing fire camp duties, possession consumption or possession by consumption of alcohol while in fire camp or on the fire line is prohibited.
