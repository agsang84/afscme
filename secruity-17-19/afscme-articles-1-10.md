## Article 1 - SCOPE OF AGREEMENT

### Section 1

This Agreement is made and entered into by and between the State of Oregon \(hereinafter the "Employer"\), acting through its Department of Administrative Services, Labor Relations Unit on behalf of the Department of Corrections \(hereinafter the "Agency"\), and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Council 75 \(AFL-CIO\) \(hereinafter the "Union"\), and is binding upon the Union Agency and the Employer and all designated representatives of the Union, Agency and the Employer.

### Section 2

The Employer and Agency recognize the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the employees within the certified or recognized bargaining units. All aspects of the employees' wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment shall be determined by this Agreement, except in regard to recruitment and selection of applicants for initial appointment to State service. The terms and conditions of employment set forth in this Agreement shall apply to all classified positions \(except temporary positions and those positions excludable by [**ORS 243.650**](../../../laws-and-rules/ors/ors-243.650/) within the appropriate bargaining units within the Department of Corrections which are:

All employees in the strike prohibited classifications of Correctional Officer, Correctional Corporal and Correctional Sergeant within the Department of Corrections, excluding supervisory, managerial and confidential employees as defined in [**ORS 243.650**](../../../laws-and-rules/ors/ors-243.650/), temporary employees and employees represented by the Association of Oregon Corrections Employees at Oregon State Penitentiary, Oregon State Correction Institution, South Fork Forest Camp and Mill Creek Correctional Facility.

### Section 3

If the Agency establishes a new position which is not clearly excluded from the bargaining unit under [**ORS 243.650**](../../../laws-and-rules/ors/ors-243.650/) or reclassifies an existing bargaining unit position, the Agency shall notify the Union in writing within seven \(7\) days following the action, as to whether or not it believes the classification to be within the bargaining unit. The Union must notify the Employer in writing within ten \(10\) days from receipt of the notification if it disagrees about the inclusion or exclusion of the classification in the bargaining unit or the matter becomes closed. If notice of the disagreement is received within the ten \(10\)-day period, the Parties shall meet within fourteen \(14\) days of above notification to discuss the matter. If an agreement is not reached within thirty \(30\) days, the Union may submit the matter to the Employment Relations Board. Should the matter not be submitted to the Employment Relations Board within the specified thirty \(30\)-day period, the matter shall be considered resolved.

### Section 4

This contract incorporates the sole and complete Agreement between the Agency and the Union resulting from negotiations held pursuant to the provisions of [**ORS 243.650**](../../../laws-and-rules/ors/ors-243.650/) et seq and supersedes all prior labor contracts. It is acknowledged that during negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each party had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter appropriate for collective bargaining and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the Parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. It shall not be modified in whole or in part except by another written instrument duly executed by the Parties.

### Section 5

a. This agreement will prevail whenever there is a conflict with applicable Employer Chief Human Resource Office Personnel Policies and Agency Procedures relating to their implementation, consistent with [**Appendix A**](afscme-appendixes.md#appendix-a).

b. Other policies, procedures, and rules of the Agency which directly relate to mandatory subjects of bargaining as defined by statute and which affect bargaining unit members on the day this Agreement becomes effective shall be continued, unless modified or deleted elsewhere in this Agreement. Should the Agency wish to change such a policy, procedure, or rule, or to issue a new one, notice will be given to the Union. If the Union believes the policy, procedure, or rule to be unreasonable, then within seven \(7\) days of the date upon which the Union knows, or by reasonable diligence should have known, of the subject action, the Union shall request that the Agency meet to discuss the issue.

c. Such meeting shall occur within fifteen \(15\) days of:

1. Agreement that the issue is a mandatory subject, or
2. An Employment Relations Board ruling that the issue is a mandatory subject of bargaining.

If agreement which alters the policy, procedure or rule is reached, it shall be reduced to writing and signed by both Parties. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement within fourteen \(14\) days following the Level C meeting and the Union continues to believe the policy, procedure, or rule to be unreasonable, it shall notify the Agency in writing of its intent to submit the matter to interest arbitration. Such written notification must be made during the fifteen \(15\)-day period immediately following the above mentioned fourteen \(14\)-day period. Failure to file such written notification within the prescribed time shall be understood by both Parties to waive the Union's right to any further objection.

d. The Parties shall meet within the five \(5\) days immediately following receipt of notification of the Union's desire to arbitrate and select an arbitrator. Selection of an arbitrator shall be as prescribed in [**Article 51, Grievance and Arbitration**](afscme-article-51-56.md#article-51-grievance-and-arbitration).  
  
e. The Parties agree that the decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on each of the Parties and that they will abide thereby, unless the award is vacated pursuant to statute. The power of the arbitrator in this process shall be limited to determine whether the policy, procedure, or rule is unreasonable.

If the arbitrator's ruling is that the policy, procedure, or rule is unreasonable, the Agency shall immediately withdraw the policy, procedure or rule.

f. The arbitrator's fee and expenses shall be paid by the losing party. If, in the opinion of the arbitrator, neither party can be considered the losing party, then such expenses shall be apportioned as in the arbitrator's judgment is equitable. All other expenses shall be borne exclusively by the party requiring the service or item for which payment is to be made.

g. Time limits specified in this procedure must be observed, unless either party requests a specific extension of time, which, if agreed to, must be stipulated in writing and shall become part of the record.

The Agency agrees to allow duly certified Union Representatives up to sixty \(60\) minutes, to speak to new employees about the Union's exclusive recognition, its benefits, and services available to the membership. This time will not be used for discussion of labor-management disputes.

During periods of bona fide emergency, this provision may be temporarily suspended by the Agency as required for the duration of the emergency.

### Section 3

Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the internal business of the Union shall be conducted by the employees during non-duty time.

All policies, procedures, and rules, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be applied equitably among employees to whom they apply.

### Section 4 - Stewards

The Union may select, and shall certify in writing to the Agency, employees to act as Union Stewards. The Union will provide an updated list when authorized stewards are added or removed. With prior approval by management, stewards shall have authority to investigate and resolve grievances, alleged violations of the agreement before a written grievance is filed \(Step 1 of the grievance process\), and to distribute Union informational material provided that such activity does not interfere with the regular work routine.

The investigation and processing of employee grievances and reasonable time to investigate alleged violations of the agreement before a grievance is filed will be permitted during working hours without loss of compensation. If the permitted activities would interfere with either the Steward's or the grievant's duties, management shall, within the next working day, arrange a mutually satisfactory time for the requested activities. Time spent in grievance activities without the proper notification and release by an appropriate supervisor involved will be considered unauthorized leave without pay for both the Steward and the grievant. An employee may request and have present a Shop Steward or Union Representative at any formal discussion on disciplinary actions, or grievance proceedings, or any other matter that might adversely and substantially affect their future employment, pay, or chances for promotion.

The employee, at his/her request, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to select a representative from the list of authorized AFSCME stewards within the bargaining unit at their functional unit. When there is a potential conflict between the employee and a steward, or a steward within the bargaining unit is unavailable, then the designated Council Representative or the local unit President shall be contacted to assist in determining alternative representation.

Management will provide written notification to an officer of the Local Union and the Union Business Agent of an impending disciplinary action \(suspension, reduction, demotion or dismissal\) against an employee. The Agency will also send to the Union Local President letters of reprimand and letters of expectation it has issued to employees.

### Section 5 - Union Business Leave

Union Business Leave does not constitute a break in service.

AFSCME shall indemnify and hold the State and Agency harmless against any and all claims, damages, suits, or other forms of liability which may arise out of any action taken or not taken by the Employer and/or Agency for the purpose of complying with this provision.

For Short and Long Term leave, AFSCME shall, within thirty \(30\) days of receipt of specific billing, reimburse the Agency for payment of appropriate salary, benefits, paid leave time, pension, and all other employer-related costs.

Such requests will be granted unless the affected Functional Unit can demonstrate that the employeeâ€™s absence would adversely impact the operating needs of the employeeâ€™s work unit.

If the Agency cannot grant such leave based on lack of funding, the Union may offer to reimburse, within thirty \(30\) days of receipt of billing, the Agency for required overtime costs \(including: salary, benefits, paid leave time, pensions and all other employer-related costs\) to allow the designated employee to take Union business leave. The Agency and the Union agree to meet and discuss and clarify if any overtime costs are to be paid by the Union prior to the requested leave. If no agreement is reached the employeeâ€™s request may be denied.

### Section 8 - Fair Share

The terms of the contract have been made for all employees in the bargaining unit, not solely for members of the Union. The Parties recognize that it is fair that each employee in the bargaining unit should bear a fair share of the costs incurred by the Union in meeting its responsibilities as a recognized bargaining unit representative.

Each employee not exempt under recognition of this contract shall, within thirty \(30\) days of hire, have deducted monthly from their pay by the State, a sum equal to the amount of current Union dues. Such sum shall constitute the employee's dues if the employee is a member of the Union, or shall otherwise constitute that employee's fair and equitable contribution to the expenses of administering this contract on the employee's behalf by the Union. Such deduction shall be made only if accrued earnings are sufficient to cover the service fee after all other authorized payroll deductions have been made.

The deduction and disbursement to the Union of dues and service fees provided herein shall be accomplished monthly by the State and payment to the Union shall be made on or before the fifteenth day following the date such deductions were made.

Any employee who is a member of a bona fide religious organization which teaches as a doctrine of faith that payment of Union dues is wrong may follow the procedures allowed by State law to have in lieu of dues payment paid to a non-religious charity.

The Union shall indemnify and save the Agency harmless against any and all claims, damages, suits or other forms of liability which may arise out of any action taken or not taken by the Agency for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this section.

### Section 10 - Maintenance of Membership
