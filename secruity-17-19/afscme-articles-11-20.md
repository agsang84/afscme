# AFSCME Articles 11-20

## ARTICLE 11 - CONTRACTING OUT

The Agency may determine to contract or subcontract work provided that, as to work which is presently and regularly performed by employees in the bargaining unit, the Agency agrees to notify the Union and negotiate the decision and impact of the pending action. It is specifically understood that such negotiations are not required in

1. emergency situations, 
2. where the impact is minimal \(and not mandatory\), or 
3. where the assignment of work currently being performed by the bargaining unit members is transferred to other State facilities.

## ARTICLE 12 - INSURANCE

### Section 1

An Employer contribution will be made for each eligible employee who has at least eighty \(80\) paid regular hours in the month or as required by law.

### Section 2

The contribution for eligible participating part-time employees with eighty \(80\) or more hours paid time for the month the Employer shall contribute a prorated amount of the contribution for full-time employees in the employee’s tier coverage prorated based on the ratio of paid regular hours to full time hours to the nearest full percent.

### Section 3 - Plan Years 2018 and 2019

a. For Plan Years 2018 and 2019 the Employer will pay ninety-five percent \(95%\) and the employee will pay five percent \(5%\) of the monthly premium rate for PEBB health, vision, dental and basic life insurance benefits.

b. For employees who enroll in a medical plan that is at least ten percent \(10%\) lower in cost than the monthly premium rate for the highest cost plan available to the majority of employees, the Employer shall pay ninety-nine percent \(99%\) of the monthly premium for PEBB health, vision, dental and basic life insurance benefits and the employee will pay one percent \(1%\).

### Section 4

If the Collective Bargaining Agreement provides for a COLA with an effective date of the second \(2nd\) year of a biennium and the difference in the projected increase in the PEBB composite rate for the following calendar year falls below three point four percent \(3.4%\), then the COLA will be moved up by one \(1\) full month for each month it is sufficiently funded by the savings.

## ARTICLE 13 - SALARY AND WAGES

### Section 1 - PERS and PERS Pickup Continuation

Subsections 2-4 of this Article shall continue through January 31, 2019.

### Section 2 - Public Employees Retirement System \(“PERS”\) Members

For purposes of this Section 1, “employee” means an employee who is employed by the State on August 28, 2003 and who is eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.

**Retirement Contributions.** On behalf of employees, the State will continue to “pick up” the six percent \(6%\) employee contribution, payable pursuant to law. The Parties acknowledge that various challenges have been filed that contest the lawfulness, including the constitutionality, of various aspects of PERS reform legislation enacted by the 2003 Legislative Assembly, including Chapters 67 \(HB 2003\) and 68 \(HB 2004\) of Oregon Laws 2003 \(“PERS Litigation”\). Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any party’s rights, claims or defenses with respect to the PERS Litigation.

### Section 3 - Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan Pension Program Members

For purposes of this Section 2, “employee” means an employee who is employed by the State on or after August 29, 2003 and who is not eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.

**Contributions to Individual Account Programs.** As of the date that an employee becomes a member of the Individual Account Program established by Section 29 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003, and pursuant to Section 3 of that same chapter, the State will pay an amount equal to six percent \(6%\) of the employee’s monthly salary,not to be deducted from the salary, as the employee’s contribution to the employee’s account in that program. The employee’s contributions paid by the State under this Section 2 shall not be considered to be “salary” for the purposes of determining the amount of employee contributions required to be contributed pursuant to Section 32 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.

### Section 4 - Effect of Changes in Law \(Other than PERS Litigation\)

In the event that the State’s payment of a six percent \(6%\) employee contribution under Section 1 or under Section 2, as applicable, must be discontinued due to a change in law, valid ballot measure, constitutional amendment, or a final, non-appealable judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction \(other than in the PERS Litigation\), the State shall increase by six percent \(6%\) the base salary rates for each classification in the salary schedules in lieu of the six percent \(6%\) pick-up. This transition shall be done in a manner to assure continuous payment of either the six percent \(6%\) contribution or a six percent \(6%\) salary increase.

For the reasons indicated above, or by mutual agreement, if the State ceases paying the applicable six percent \(6%\) pickup and instead provides a salary increase for eligible bargaining unit employees during the term of the Agreement, and bargaining unit employees are able, under then-existing law, to make their own six percent \(6%\) contributions to their PERS account or the Individual Account Program account, as applicable, such employees’ contributions shall be treated as “pre-tax” contributions pursuant to Internal Revenue Code, Section 414\(h\)\(2\).

### Section 5

Effective February 1, 2019 compensation plan salary rates for PERS participating members shall be increased by six and ninety five hundredths percent \(6.95%\). At that time bargaining unit employees will begin to make their own six percent \(6%\) contributions to their PERS account or the Individual Account Program as applicable. Employees’ contributions shall be treated as ‘pretax’ contributions pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 414\(h\)\(2\).

### Section 6 - Salary Adjustments

Effective June 15, 2018 all pay rates shall be increased by one percent \(1%\).

### Section 7 - Selective Market Adjustment

Effective January 1, 2019, the following classifications shall be adjusted as indicated below:

| Class \# | Classification Title | Salary From | Range To |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6775 | Corrections Officer | 17 | 18 |
| 6776 | Corporal | 18 | 19 |
| 6777 | Sergeant | 20 | 21 |

The new top step for each classification shall be six percent \(6%\) increase from the old top step to the new top step.

Effective January 1, 2019, all employees will retain their current salary rate in the new range except that employees whose current rate is below the first \(1st\) step of the new range shall be moved to the first \(1st\) step in the new range and a new salary eligibility date will be established twelve \(12\) months later. For an employee whose rate is within the new salary range, but not a corresponding salary step, his/her salary shall be adjusted to the next higher rate closest to his/her current salary, effective January 1, 2019.

### Section 8 - Elimination of DPSST Differential

a. An employee who receives either the DPSST three percent \(3%\) Intermediate certification differential or six percent \(6%\) Advanced certification differential and is not at the top step of the salary range for their classification, will, in lieu of receiving the DPSST certification differential, receive a three percent \(3%\) or six percent \(6%\) salary adjustment, whichever is applicable, and shall be placed into the new salary range effective January 1, 2019. For an employee whose rate is within the new salary range, but not a corresponding salary step, his/her salary shall remain off step and shall continue to receive annual step increases until he/she reaches top step of the range. No employee will receive an annual step increase that places him/her above the top step of the range.

b. By this adjustment, the DPSST certification differential in [**Article 16, Section 5**](afscme-articles-11-20.md#section-5-incentive-plan) ends December 31, 2018.

### Section 9 - Recoupment of Wage and Benefit Overpayments/Underpayments

**a. Overpayments.** In the event that an employee receives wages or benefits from the Agency to which the employee is not entitled, regardless of whether the employee knew or should have known of the overpayment, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing of the overpayment which will include information supporting that an overpayment exists and the amount of wages and/or benefits to be repaid. For purposes of recovering overpayments by payroll deduction, the following shall apply.

1. The employee with or without Union representation and the Agency shall meet and attempt to reach mutual agreement on a repayment schedule within thirty \(30\) calendar days following receipt of written notification. For purposes of this section, the Agency sending a certified letter to the employee at their last known home address and email to the employee’s work address shall constitute ‘receipt of written notice’. 
2. If there is no mutual agreement at the end of the thirty \(30\) calendar day period the Agency shall implement the repayment schedule stated in subsection 3 below. 
3. If the overpayment amount to be repaid is more than five percent \(5%\) of the employee’s regular monthly base salary, the overpayment shall be recovered in monthly amounts not exceeding five percent \(5%\) of the employee’s regular base salary. If an overpayment is less than five percent \(5%\) of the employee’s regular monthly base salary, the overpayment shall be recovered in a lump sum deduction from the employee’s paycheck. If an employee leaves Agency service before the Agency fully recovers the overpayment, the remaining amount may be deducted from the employee’s final check\(s\). 
4. Subsections 1-3 of this Section shall not apply to payroll adjustments necessitated by a discrepancy between actual hours of paid time versus hours projected for payroll purposes from one pay period to another. For example, if an employee utilizes leave without pay near the end of a month but is paid for such time because such leave without pay was not anticipated at the payroll cutoff date for that month, the employee’s pay and benefit entitlements may be adjusted on the following month’s paycheck. 
5. The Agency shall not attempt to correct any overpayment to employees discovered older than two \(2\) years from notification.

**b. Underpayments.** In the event the employee does not receive the wages or benefits to which the record/documentation has for all times indicated the employer agreed the employee was entitled, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing of the underpayment. This notification will include information showing that an underpayment exists and the amount of wages and/or benefits to be repaid. The Agency shall correct any such underpayment made within a maximum period of two \(2\) years before the notification.

c. This provision shall not apply to claims disputing eligibility for payments which result from this agreement. Employees claiming eligibility for such things as leadwork, work out-of- classification pay or reclassification must pursue those claims pursuant to the timelines elsewhere in this Agreement.

## ARTICLE 14 - SALARY ADMINISTRATION

### Section 1

Salary eligibility date is defined as the date an employee is eligible for an annual performance pay increase. The salary eligibility date is computed from the date of hire. Employees shall be eligible for annual performance pay increases on the employees' salary eligibility date provided the employee is not at the top step of the salary range of the employees' classification. The employee may be denied the annual performance pay increase if there has been a serious performance or attendance problem. Denials are subject to review within six \(6\) months. Denials may be grieved under the provisions of [**Article 51**](afscme-article-51-56.md#article-51-grievance-and-arbitration).

### Section 2

Any employee requiring an emergency draw shall be authorized once during the term of this Agreement to make such a draw without explanation. Additional draws may be requested in accord with existing policy and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Section 3 - Submission of Salary Increases

a. For employees initially hired to state service, the salary eligibility date shall be set one \(1\) year from date of hire. However, an employee’s salary eligibility date may only change because of employment actions as a result of reallocations, trial service extensions as provided in [**Article 41**](afscme-article-41-50.md#article-41-trial-service) promotions, demotions, reemployments, reclassifications or leaves without pay in excess of thirty \(30\) days except those leaves protected by federal or state law \(FMLA, military, workers compensation\).

b. Salary increases to correct errors or oversights and retroactive payments resulting from grievance settlements will be authorized. In no event shall any retroactivity exceed two \(2\) years from the date upon which the oversight or error is brought to management’s attention in writing, or, in the case of a grievance settlement, the date the grievance was filed in writing.

### Section 4 - Salary on Lateral Transfer

a. An employee who transfers into the security bargaining unit from another bargaining unit inside of the Agency or from another executive branch state agency in the same salary range will retain his/her base salary rate and salary eligibility date. However, where the employee’s current base pay rate is below Step 1 of the security bargaining unit base pay rate the employee’s base rate will be moved to Step 1 of the same salary range. If an employee’s straight time pay rate is above the top step of the range, the employee will be placed at the top step of the range.

b. If an employee’s base pay rate caused them to be placed off step in the new classification and salary range, then at their next salary eligibility date, if qualified, the employee shall be granted an annual step increase plus the dollar amount that his/her current salary is below the next higher step not to exceed the top step of the range.

### Section 5 - Salary on Promotion

An employee shall be given an increase to the next higher rate in the new salary range effective on the date of the promotion and the employee’s salary eligibility date shall be set for six \(6\) calendar months after the date of promotion. Upon successful completion of promotional trail service, the employee will receive a salary increase and annually thereafter until the employee reaches the top step of the range.

### Section 6 - Salary on Demotion

Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a lower range that has a salary rate the same as the previous step, the employee's salary shall be maintained at that step in the lower range.

Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a salary range which does not have salary steps corresponding with the employee's previous salary but is within the new salary range, the employee's salary shall be maintained at the current rate until the next eligibility date. At the employee's next salary eligibility date, if qualified, the employee shall be granted a salary rate increase of one \(1\) full step within the new salary range plus that amount that their current salary is below the next higher rate in the salary range. This increase shall not exceed the highest rate in the new salary range.

Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a lower range, but the employee's previous salary is above the highest step for that range, the employee shall be paid at the highest step in the new salary range.

This Section shall not apply to demotions resulting from official disciplinary actions.

### Section 7 - Effect of Break in Service

When an employee separates from State service and subsequently returns to the State service \(except as a temporary employee\), the employee's salary eligibility date shall be determined by the Agency as follows:

#### a. Return from Layoff List

When a former employee who was laid off is recalled, the employee will be paid at the step they were at the time of layoff. Employee's previous salary eligibility date adjusted by the amount of break in service shall be restored.

#### b. Return from Reemployment

When a former employee is reemployed to a position in the same class in which the employee was previously employed or in a related class with the same salary range, the employee may be paid at or below the step at which the employee was being paid at the time of termination. If an employee is reemployed in a position in a class with a lower salary range than that of the employee's previous position, the employee may be paid at any step in the lower salary range not exceeding the rate the employee was being paid in the higher class, except where exceptional circumstances justify payment of a higher rate. The previous eligibility date adjusted by the amount of break in service shall represent the salary eligibility date following return.

### Section 8 - Salary Underpayments

a. In the event the Agency determines an employee has not received wages/benefits to which he/she is lawfully entitled pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act or state law, the Agency shall pay the employee within three \(3\) working days the amount of money the employee is owed if such underpayment is equal to or more than five percent \(5%\) of the employee’s base pay rate.

b. In the event the Agency determines an employee has not received wages/benefits to which he/she is lawfully entitled, the Agency shall pay the employee at the next first \(1st\) of the month payday the amount of money the employee is owed if such underpayment is less than five percent \(5%\) of the employee’s base pay rate. If the Agency determines there is an underpayment obligation after the normal payroll cutoff date and before the mid month cutoff date, the Agency shall pay the employee on the mid month check.

c. This Section shall not apply to claims disputing eligibility for payments which result from this Agreement. Employees claiming eligibility for leadwork differential, work out of classification, reclassification or any differential pay shall pursue those claims pursuant to [**Article 51 \(Grievance Procedure\)**](afscme-article-51-56.md#article-51-grievance-and-arbitration).

### Section 9

Overtime, holiday and all differentials may be paid on the fifteenth \(15th\) of the month at the employee’s discretion. Once an employee designates they want to have overtime, holiday and differentials paid on the fifteenth \(15th\) of each month, the designation will continue for twelve \(12\) consecutive calendar months without change. The employee will follow all processes necessary to ensure his/her request is properly implemented.

## ARTICLE 15 - OVERTIME

### Section 1

All time for which an employee is compensated at the regular straight time rate of pay, except on-call time but including holiday time off, compensatory time off, and other paid leave, shall be counted as time worked.

### Section 2

Overtime for employees working a regular workweek is time worked in excess of eight \(8\) hours per day or forty \(40\) hours per week within the employee's basic workweek.

Overtime for employees working an irregular work schedule four/ten \(4/10\) is time worked in excess of the scheduled hours per day or forty \(40\) hours per week within the employee's basic workweek.

Time worked beyond regular schedule by employees scheduled for less than eight \(8\) hours per day or forty \(40\) hours per week is additional straight time worked rather than overtime until work exceeds eight \(8\) hours per day or forty \(40\) hours per week within the employee's basic workweek.

### Section 3 - Shift Change Penalty

Except for shift changes requested by the employee, if a shift change requires that an employee work more than five \(5\) consecutive days, the employee will be compensated at the rate of time and one-half \(1-1/2\) for all hours worked in excess of forty \(40\) hours within the employee's prior work- week. If an employee is required to work more than eight \(8\) hours in any twenty-four \(24\)-hour period, the employee shall be paid at the overtime rate for all hours in excess of eight \(8\) during that same twenty-four \(24\)-hour period. Employee workweek is defined as the seven \(7\)-day period beginning with the employee's first scheduled workday.

Shift change penalty for working more than eight \(8\) hours in a twenty-four \(24\)-hour period does not apply for shift and day off bid or requested by employees which have different starting times.

### Section 4

Overtime shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half \(1-1/2\). The form of compensation for overtime shall be pay or compensatory time off. If compensatory time is used, it shall be credited at the appropriate overtime rate. Any compensatory time accrued in excess of eighty \(80\) hours will be paid off within the pay period of the month following the month in which it is accrued.

No application of this Article shall be construed or interpreted to provide for compensation for overtime at a rate exceeding time and one-half \(1-1/2\), or to effect a "pyramiding" of overtime, i.e., time and one-half \(1-1/2\).

Overtime shall be voluntary except during periods of bona fide emergency or unless management is unable to fill a work assignment by voluntary means.

### Section 5 - Exemptions from Overtime

All employees who are exempt from overtime under the standards established by the FLSA shall be excluded from overtime. The Agency and the Union shall apply FLSA standards to reach agreement upon exempt employees.

Grievances which grieve the eligibility of employees for overtime shall follow the procedure in [**Article 51, Grievance and Arbitration**](afscme-article-51-56.md#article-51-grievance-and-arbitration), Steps 1 and 2. If the grievance is still unresolved after Step 2, the affected employee may file a charge with the Bureau of Labor and Industries \(BOLI\), Wage and Hour Division, or with the U.S. Department of Labor \(DOL\).

### Section 6

Any employee assigned to escort inmates out of State will be compensated eight \(8\) hours per day at the straight time rate, and one and one-half \(1-1/2\) times the straight time rate for any hours actually worked over eight \(8\) hours per day, unless escorting on the employee's regular day off, where the employee shall receive overtime for the first eight \(8\) hours also.

### Section 7

Shift changes as a direct result of job bidding requiring the bidding employee to work more than five \(5\) consecutive days will be compensated at the regular straight time rate of pay.

### Section 8

The Parties agree that an employee's compensatory time is payment for work already accomplished. Compensatory time may be used by the employee in lieu of vacation or sick leave.

### Section 9 - Distribution of Voluntary Overtime

Volunteers will be sought by contact with all staff on shift followed by contact of a volunteer list as determined by local labor/management committees. No employee shall be required to work more than sixteen \(16\) hours of overtime per week unless there is an emergency or valid cause. The method of assigning and limits on mandatory overtime and limits on voluntary overtime may be determined by the local labor/management committees and formalized in a Letter of Agreement \(LOA\). Voluntary overtime may be denied for valid cause. Mandatory overtime lists will be posted.

## ARTICLE 16 - DIFFERENTIALS

### Section 1 - Shift Differentials.

a. Night shift differential shall apply to all bargaining unit members except part-time employees working less than thirty-two \(32\) hours per month.

The number of Field Training Officer assignments will be identified in the bidding instructions by each shift \(EOCI post\) and employees shall bid for a Field Training Officer assignment by shift. Institution management will assign Field Training Officers by Field Training Officer seniority. Field Training Officer seniority shall be defined as the date of DPSST certification as a Field Training Officer. If there is a tie between two \(2\) employees with the same certification date, the employee with the most Agency seniority shall be selected. If there is still a tie, it will be broken by a one time lottery draw. The Institution’s Human Resources Office will maintain and update the list as needed with a copy to the Union.   
2. Filling Field Training Officer Assignments During the Bid Cycle. 
   1. Within seven \(7\) calendar days after the regular shift/days off bid \(EOCI post\), the Institution may post any unfilled Field Training Officer assignments. Assignment shall be made by seniority.

The Institution will select an employee for the assignment pursuant to [**Agency Policy 20.7.6**](../../../odoc/odoc-policies/chapter-20/20.7.6-basic-corrections-course.md). Qualified employees are those who possess the DPSST Field Training Officer \(FTO\) Training certification. 
   3. If there are unfilled Field Training Officer assignments that remain which the Agency chooses to fill and no qualified employees submit a memorandum expressing interest, the Agency may choose to solicit employees who may be interested in becoming a DPSST Field Training Officer certified pursuant to [**Agency Policy 20.7.6**](../../../odoc/odoc-policies/chapter-20/20.7.6-basic-corrections-course.md).

This Subsection shall not apply to overtime which is essentially a continuation of the scheduled work shift. This Subsection shall not apply to telephone calls or text messages where Agency management directs the employee to report for work which then engages Section 1 of this Article instead of this Section. This Section shall not apply to employees assigned to on-call or standby duty status.
