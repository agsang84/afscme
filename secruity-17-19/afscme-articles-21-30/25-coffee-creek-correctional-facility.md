# 25 - Coffee Creek Correctional Facility

Employees who have completed initial trial service by the time the bid commences may bid for shift and days off in order of seniority as defined by Article 25, Section 8. Employees who fail to successfully bid, or who do not apply to bid, will be assigned at the discretion of the institution’s Management.

The bid schedule will be correct and finalized at least seven \(7\) days prior to the start of the bid. Bids will address only shift and days off. Management will retain the right to assign staff to posts. Bidding will occur every six \(6\) months, becoming effective on the first Sunday of April and October. The Security Office shall post work schedules thirty \(30\) calendar days prior to the rotation date. Proxy bids must be received prior to the start of the bid process.

The following definitions and practices are identified for shift and days off bidding:

1. **Lateral Transfer** – All employees that laterally transfer to CCCF from another State agency will have their seniority determined in accordance with Article 25, Section 8 of the 2009-2011 collective bargaining agreement. When an employee transfers into CCCF with the same hire date as an existing staff member, the existing staff member shall be granted the higher seniority within the classification. 
2. **New Hires** – All employees with the same hire date, will have their seniority determined by lottery with a labor representative present \(i.e., individual employees from each affected new hire grouping will draw a number\).
3. **Promotional Hires** – All employees with the same hire date will have their seniority determined by their total Agency security service. \(Agency non-security time will not count toward seniority for the purpose of bidding shift and days off.\) If two \(2\) or more employees have the same Agency security date, their seniority will be determined by lottery with a labor representative present.
4. Upon completion of the three \(3\) prior elements, the Agency agrees to provide the Union with a seniority list. The Agency agrees to update this information as necessary to include new transfers, hires and promotions.
5. The Tool and Key Control Sergeant is designated as an exempt post. No employee may fill that assignment for more than two \(2\) consecutive years. To fill/backfill this post, Management will seek memos from interested sergeants and an interview process will be conducted by a labor/management team. The sergeant backfilling this post will train with the current Tool and Key Control Sergeant as staffing allows and will become the new Tool and Key Control Sergeant when the current individual’s assignment is concluded.
6. The Group Living Officer is designated as an exempt post. To fill/backfill this post, Management will seek memos from interested officers and make a selection. The selected officer will fill the post for one \(1\) year. At least thirty \(30\) days prior to the end of that year, Management will again seek memos of interest for the position. If there are no memos of interest submitted by other officers, the current Group Living Officer may remain in that post for another year.
7. Shift and days off slots that are vacated within one-hundred and twenty \(120\) days of rotation date will be offered to interested staff using the following procedure. This shall be done as soon as is practical when an employee permanently leaves or is removed from the assignment through resignation, transfer, retirement, promotion, demotion, termination or death. Shift/days off slots opening sixty \(60\) days or less from the end of rotation will be assigned by management. The available slot will be posted and all employees can notify management of their interest within seven \(7\) days. The assignment will be awarded to the staff member based on seniority as defined in Article 25, Section 8 of the Agreement.

Secondary shift/days off slots that are vacated through the above process will be offered to interested staff. To minimize the ‘domino effect’, back filling will stop after the third \(3rd\) staff member that is reassigned as a result of the original vacant shift/days off slot. Management will then use its right to assign to make any necessary adjustments to rosters to cover workload.

The labor/management team will determine the mechanics of the bidding process. The Parties agree to review the mechanics and make necessary changes after each bid. Any agreed changes to the mechanics of the bidding process will be provided to staff no later than thirty \(30\) days prior to the bid.

The Parties agree that the intent of this Section is to provide as many work and training opportunities as possible for all security staff, regardless of seniority, while recognizing the importance of seniority and the individual choice of staff.

The institution’s management team will make the specific daily work schedules and may only remove or deny an employee from their bid for valid cause.

## Distribution of Voluntary and Mandatory Overtime

1. **The Bucket** – Overtime will first be offered to the first three \(3\) employees at the top of the bucket list, in order of one \(1\) to three \(3\). The bucket will be set up in reverse seniority order. Once an employee has been mandatoried for overtime, he or she has fulfilled their bucket obligation and his or her name will be moved to the bottom of the bucket list regardless of the amount of time worked prior to being relieved. In the event that an individual is mandatoried and is able to find another employee to work the entire overtime shift, the mandatoried employee will be moved to the bottom of the bucket list. Employees on the bucket list who volunteer to work on overtime shift in order to remove their name from the bucket list must work a minimum 3.5 hours to have their name removed. Employees who volunteer to work an overtime shift in order to meet their bucket obligation may not volunteer prior to the official activation of the bucket list at the start of each shift \(i.e. you may not volunteer 24 hours in advance of the bucket list being activated and ask that your bucket obligation be met\). Employees returning to work after an approved vacation or approved trades in conjunction with their vacation will not be in the bucket on their Monday. The bucket will rotate by date last worked.
2. **Voluntary Overtime** – If the first three \(3\) employees in the bucket do not want the overtime, the OIC will activate the voluntary overtime list and attempt to fill the vacant post from the list, in seniority order. The vacant post will be filled based on the classification normally required to fill that post. Once the OIC has exhausted the voluntary overtime list for a specified classification needed for a vacant post, Management has the right to go up or down one classification in order to fill the post. Management maintains the right to manipulate the daily rosters.
3. Employees may provide the Employer with no more than two \(2\) accurate contact phone numbers, in writing. Each phone number listed for the employee will be attempted before continuing down the overtime list. A message may be left, but the OIC will continue calling staff for the overtime assignment.
4. If activation of the voluntary overtime list fails to produce a relief for the vacant post, the OIC will notify all staff on duty that overtime is available via a radio call.
5. If the voluntary overtime list and the radio call fail to produce relief for the vacant post, the OIC will go to the top name on the bucket list and it will be mandatory for that employee to cover the vacant post.
6. Mandatory overtime will not be required on the employee’s Friday. An employee’s Friday includes the employee’s regularly scheduled Friday, or the day prior to an approved absence, such as a trade, scheduled sick day or scheduled vacation.
7. Hiring of overtime for open/vacated posts can be done up to 24 hours in advance of the shift at the OIC’s discretion. Employees on the bucket list will not bump staff who have already accepted an open overtime post.
8. a. The employee who has been bucketed is allowed to split the overtime. If the bucketed employee chooses to split overtime it is the employee’s responsibility to find another person to split it with and the bucketed employee is responsible for coverage of the complete shift \(i.e. if the staff with whom the overtime is split does not come in, the bucketed staff person needs to finish the shift themselves or find someone else to come in\). The bucketed employee must notify the OIC of the split, including the other staff member’s name and the hours to be worked by both employees. b. The employee who has volunteered for voluntary overtime is allowed to split the overtime. If the employee volunteering to work overtime chooses to split overtime, it is the employee’s responsibility to find another person to split it with and the employee volunteering is responsible for coverage of the complete shift \(i.e. the staff with whom the overtime is split does not come in, the employee volunteering for the overtime needs to finish the shift themselves or find someone else to come in\). The employee volunteering for overtime work must notify the OIC of the split, including the other staff member’s name and the hours to be worked by both employees.
9. If the need for overtime no longer exists, the order in which employees are sent home will be in the reverse order in which the overtime was hired \(i.e. bucketed employees, then voluntary overtime employees in order of last hired, first sent home\).
10. Employees working in the 5% Flex Sergeant and Corporal assignments will not be included in the bucket.
11. Employees who are assigned to training due to voluntary, collateral duties and incur overtime will not be moved down in the bucket list. Employees who are assigned to training they did not volunteer for and incur overtime will be moved down in the bucket list at their request.

## Trades

The following practices are identified regarding time trades:

1. Time trade request will be in writing and signed by the affected employees and shall contain specific dates of the trade. Supervisors shall not withhold approval of time trades without valid cause. Trade requests must be received in the security office at least seven \(7\) days in advance.
2. Time trade requests may not be changed unless mutually agreed to by the Parties through submission of a new request or cancellation of the original request.
3. All time trades must be completed within the shift/days off bid in which they are initiated.
4. The Assistant Superintendent of Security or designee may extend the completion period at their discretion and with the agreement of the affected employee\(s\).
5. Failure to complete a trade may result in trade restrictions.
6. The OIC may approve trades initiated within the seven \(7\) day window.

## Vacation Bidding

1. Employees on trial service may bid for weeks that occur after their trial service ends.
2. Management will provide current vacation accruals to the bid proctors prior to the start of the bid process.
3. Bid schedules and seniority lists will be correct and finalized at least seven \(7\) days prior to the start of the bid process.
4. Proxy bids must be received prior to the start of the bid process.
