# 25 - Columbia River Correctional Institution

## Bidding Process

Employees who have completed initial trial service may bid shifts and days off in order of seniority as defined in Section 8 of this Article. Employees whose trial service will be completed prior to the effective date of the shift and days off change \(first Sunday of April and October\) shall be allowed to participate in the shift and days off bidding process. Employees who fail to successfully bid, or who do not apply or bid, will be assigned at the discretion of the institution's management.

Bids will address only shift and days off. Bidding will occur every six \(6\) months, becoming effective on the first Sunday of April and October. The Security Manager shall post work schedules thirty \(30\) calendar days before the rotation date. The mechanics of the bidding procedure shall be determined in consultation with the Union at labor/management meetings. All bids must be in writing, signed by the bidding employee, and numbered by preference, if placing more than one \(l\) bid. Employees may submit up to three \(3\) bids. The new schedule will be posted no less than seven \(7\) calendar days prior to the effective date.

The institution's management will make the specific daily work schedules and may remove or deny an employee from a bid for valid cause.

## Security of Personal Property

The Agency agrees to continue reasonable efforts to provide security for employees authorized personal property.

## Seniority

Shift and days off bidding will be in conformance with Section 8 of this Article. The following clarifications are as follows:

### New Hires

Newly hired employees with the same date of hire will have their seniority determined by lottery drawing with a Union representative present.

### Transfers

When a staff member transfers into CRCI with the same date of hire as an existing staff member, the existing staff member shall be granted the higher seniority within the classification.

### Promotional Hires

When newly promoted staff have the same promotional hire date their seniority will first be determined by total bargaining unit seniority. If bargaining unit seniority is equal, total Agency time in the security series will be utilized to determine the higher seniority. If seniority would still be the same, seniority will be determined by lottery drawing with a union representative present.

## Overtime:

Assignment of work to security series staff which exceeds their normal work schedule or as defined by [**Article 15** ](25-columbia-river-correctional-institution.md)of this Agreement.

### Voluntary Overtime

Assignment of overtime based upon a voluntary request by individual staff to work beyond their normal schedule.

### Voluntary Overtime List

A list of all correctional series staff requesting to work voluntary overtime, which is maintained by the Security Manager or management designee.

### Mandatory Overtime

Assignment of overtime by the Security Manager or management designee by which staff are required to work beyond their normal work schedule.

### Mandatory Overtime Bucket List

A perpetual list of all correctional series staff in inverse order of the last date of overtime worked, maintained by the Security Manager or management designee.

### Unscheduled Overtime

Overtime assignments made as a result of unexpected absences, vacancies, or additional work that is known less than twenty-four \(24\) hours in advance.

### Seniority

Total length of continuous Agency \(DOC\) service in the security series unbroken by separation of employment of more than one-hundred and eighty \(180\) days.

### Overtime Hours Calculation

Voluntary overtime assignments accepted and/or worked, plus assessed overtime hours, rounded up or down to the nearest hour for the purpose of assigning overtime. Mandatory overtime hours worked will not be counted as overtime worked for the purpose of calculating voluntary overtime requests. Staff compensated for missed overtime opportunities will have those hours added to their overtime calculation for the month in which the work opportunity occurred upon written notification to the staff member and the local union.

### Assessed Overtime Hours

Overtime hours counted against an employee when they accept an overtime assignment and subsequently voluntarily choose to not work the assignment.

It is recognized that the assignment of overtime will be made consistent with the requirement to maintain safety and security of the institution and the community. The intent is to assign overtime to all staff equitably.

## Voluntary Overtime Sign Up Sheet/List

1. The Security Manager or Officer in Charge will maintain an overtime list showing who has worked or been assessed overtime hours with the date and number of hours worked. The overtime list will be updated continually and recalculated from zero at the beginning of each calendar month. 
2. The Officer-In-Charge \(OIC\) will possess and make available the Voluntary Overtime List for staff to request overtime assignments at each shift briefing and throughout the work day in the OIC’s office. Staff may contact the OIC by phone to add their name to the list.
3. Correctional series staff may add or delete their names from the Voluntary Overtime List in person at any time. Staff members and the OIC will place their initials on all deletions as evidence of removal.
4. When the Overtime list is activated the OIC will draw a line in red pen under the last name listed and write the date, time and initial it legibly. Any further names added below the line will be considered only after all of the names above the line have been called.
5. Voluntary Overtime Lists will be retained a minimum of sixty \(60\) days and will be available for staff to review.
6. Temporary hires will not be placed on the Voluntary Overtime Sign Up Sheet/List.

## Unscheduled Voluntary Overtime

When required to fill unscheduled absences or unexpected workload, the Officer-In-Charge \(OIC\) will:

1. When the OIC becomes aware of the overtime opportunity, they will activate the Voluntary Overtime List and award the overtime opportunity to the most senior staff member who has signed up with the least amount of overtime hours for the calendar month. If staff requesting assignment have worked an equal amount of overtime, the most senior staff will be granted the assignment. Staff will be allowed thirty \(30\) minutes response time to accept or decline overtime opportunities prior to the OIC calling the next person on the Voluntary Overtime List. In all instances, as long as time allows, the OIC will wait thirty \(30\) minutes from the first attempted contact, whether contact was made or not, before calling the next person on the Voluntary Overtime List. The OIC will call the primary phone number designated by staff. If there is no answer, the OIC will leave a message. If unable to contact the staff member after thirty \(30\) minutes has passed, the OIC will continue to the next volunteer on the list and allow the same opportunity until a volunteer is found or the list is exhausted of volunteers. This process will happen in all instances as long as time allows. The OIC will document the results of all contacts for each staff member that is contacted or attempted to be contacted. In the event overtime becomes available within four \(4\) hours prior to the scheduled work assignment, OICs may fill the overtime assignment with the first person to accept the assignment from the overtime list waiving the thirty \(30\) minute response time for staff to respond.
2. If no volunteers are located through the use of the Voluntary Overtime List, or if there is a no call no show situation at or during shift change – the OIC will skip section 1 above and, the OIC shall contact all staff on shift for volunteers as early as possible upon notice of overtime availability. If two \(2\) or more employees request the overtime, the staff member who has worked the least amount of overtime for the calendar month will be selected. If the amount of overtime is equal, the most senior staff will be assigned. In a no call no show situation at or during shift change that an all call from the previous shift does not produce a volunteer, the OIC will activate the mandatory overtime bucket list for the previous shift in accordance to the mandatory overtime procedures in this Article.
3. On-duty staff who volunteers for unscheduled overtime assignments will be notified of a decision thirty \(30\) minutes after the original announcement, or as soon as time permits after the thirty \(30\) minutes has expired. Any additional request from staff following the granting of the overtime assignment will not be considered.
4. If there are no volunteers from the shift within thirty \(30\) minutes, the OIC will inform the staff member who is on top of the Mandatory Overtime List they are required to remain until a staff member is located.
5. Once an OIC has notified a staff member they have been mandated, the OIC must attempt to contact all off duty staff to find a volunteer. A perpetual list, in seniority order, will be kept documenting calling attempts. Staff may submit an email to the Operations Lieutenant requesting to be placed on the overtime call list. A staff member who is mandated to work overtime will be moved automatically to the bottom of the mandatory overtime list after his/her mandatory time.
6. Staff may decline to work voluntary overtime.
7. Unscheduled overtime may not be assigned more than twenty-four \(24\) hours in advance of the shift to be worked. The intent is to allow as many staff as possible the opportunity to be considered for the available shift.
8. When staff are awarded voluntary overtime, they are not authorized to split the overtime with another staff member.
9. Once a staff member is contacted for overtime, they will not be contacted again until the list is exhausted.

## Mandatory Overtime

All overtime shifts will first be assigned by the means of volunteers. If there are no volunteers, staff will be assigned to overtime from the Mandatory Overtime List as follows:

1. The OIC will announce in Muster and note on the Daily Roster, who is on top of the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List.
2. If the OIC is unable to cover a vacant work assignment with a volunteer, they may require the employee at the top of the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List to work the overtime.
3. Correctional Series staff will not be required to work a mandatory overtime on their last work day before their scheduled days off or before any scheduled leave, including trades. An employee, upon the first day of work after a scheduled bid vacation or scheduled bid vacation in conjunction with trades, will be exempt for the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List for that day.
4. Employees can split mandatory overtime assignments. No more than two \(2\) employees can split a shift. The employees must be qualified to perform the work assigned. It will be the responsibility of the employee wishing to split a mandatory overtime shift to find another employee to split the shift. If an employee is found to split the shift, the employee originally assigned to work the mandatory overtime assignment will inform the OIC. If the employee coming in to finish the shift does not report to work, the employee required to work the mandatory overtime will be required to finish the shift. The overtime for the relieving employee shall count as voluntary overtime.
5. Employees who work thirty \(30\) minutes or more of voluntary overtime will be moved to the bottom of the Mandatory Overtime List. The dates of all overtime worked will be recorded.
6. The OIC will keep a list of who has worked overtime with the date and how many hours worked.
7. New hire employees will be placed on the top of the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List upon completion of their initial five \(5\) week of Agency training and two \(2\) weeks of institution orientation and on-the-job-training.
8. Temporary hires will not be placed on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List.
9. Staff who are compensated for missed overtime opportunities will have the hours credited as being worked in regards to their placement on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List.
10. When two or more staff has been mandated to work and a volunteer has been located the last person mandated to work will be the first person to be released from duty unless mutually agreed otherwise between staff.

## Medical Exceptions:

1. Correctional Series staff may be exempted from mandatory overtime assignment due to documented medical conditions. Such an exemption shall “normally be limited to a thirty \(30\) day period with extensions possible not to exceed a total of ninety \(90\) days, following continued improvement toward return to full unrestricted duty \(full release from the attending physician\).
2. Staff exempted from overtime will be noted as not eligible to work overtime, voluntary or mandatory.
3. The Security Manager or management designee will review the status of staff exempted consistent with [**DOC Policy 20.5.17**](../../../../odoc/odoc-policies/chapter-20/20.5.17-management-of-injured-workers.md).

## Trades

The following current practices at CRCI are identified regarding time trades:

1. Failure to complete a trade may result in trade restriction guidelines as set forth below: a. First time a trade is missed the person missing the trade will be given a warning. b. Second occurrence in six \(6\) months will result in a one \(1\) month trade restriction. c. Third occurrence within six \(6\) months will result in a six \(6\) month trade restriction.
2. Institution management has the discretion to approve time trades within the seven \(7\) day window for non-routine situations.
3. Employees who are scheduled to work a time trade on the following shift or a shift on the following day will be exempt from the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List. Implement this subsection for a six \(6\) month period starting on the effective date of the 2013-2015 agreement. At six \(6\) months, the Parties will meet to review the experience with this subsection. The provision will not continue unless the Parties agree otherwise.
