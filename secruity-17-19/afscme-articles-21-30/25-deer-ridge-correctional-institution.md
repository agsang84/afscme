# 25 - Deer Ridge Correctional Institution

Employees who have completed initial trial service may bid shift and days off in order of seniority as defined by Article 25, Section 8. Employees who fail to successfully bid, or who do not submit a bid, will be assigned at the discretion of the Institution’s Management.

Bids will address only shift and days off. Bidding will occur every six months, becoming effective on the first Sunday of March and September. The Security Manager will post all available shift and days off at least thirty \(30\) calendar days prior to the rotation date.

The following mechanics will be utilized for shift and days off bidding:

1. Lateral Transfers are calculated according to Article 25 Section 8 and credited with AFSCME Security bargaining unit time in class for the purposes of their seniority placement..
2. Employees with time in class with AOCE Security shall not be granted such time for the purposes of their seniority in accordance with Article 25 Section 8 but will be placed ahead of new hires hired on the same date without any ODOC experience.
3. Promotional Hires will have seniority determined first by effective date of promotion. If groups of employees are promoted on the same date, the initial tie breaker will be total AFSCME Security bargaining unit time. If that does not resolve the tie, then those employees’ seniority will be determined by a onetime lottery drawing \(i.e., individual employees from each affected new hire grouping will draw a number\).
4. New employees hired on the same date will have their seniority determined by a onetime lottery drawing.
5. When an employee transfers into DRCI with the same AFSCME Classification seniority as a current DRCI employee, the current DRCI employee shall be granted the higher seniority.
6. The Tool and Key Control duties will be assigned by management. This provision will end when DRCI Medium facility opens and a dedicated Tool and Key position\(s\) become part of the DRCI staffing plan.

## Section 1 - DRCI Shift Bid Process

Until the medium facility is activated, the process and the order of bidding positions shall be as follows:

1. Bidding shall occur in the following order: Officers, Corporals and then Sergeants shall bid according to their time in classification seniority.
2. Sergeants will first bid on the positions that are designated as Sergeant classification and if there is a remainder they shall bid on any vacant Corporal or Officer positions that remain available after the Officers and Corporals have bid.
3. This process can be revised only during successor negotiations or a mutually agreed Letter of Agreement executed by the Parties.

The mechanics of the bidding procedure will be determined at labor/management. All bids must be in writing, signed by the bidding employee, and numbered by preference, if placing more than one \(1\) bid. The results of the bids with seniority prevailing will be arranged into the master roster template that generates the daily work schedules and will be posted no less than seven \(7\) calendar days prior to the rotation date.

The Institution’s management team will make the specific daily work schedules and may only remove or deny an employee from their specific daily work schedule for valid cause.

Security of Personal Property – The agency agrees to continue reasonable efforts to provide security for employees authorized personal property.

## Section 2 - Mid Shift Rotation Bid Assignment Process.

Shift and Days off slots that are vacated within one-hundred and twenty \(120\) days of rotation date will be offered to interested staff using the following procedure. This will be done as soon as is practical after Management believes a slot will be vacant \(i.e. after incumbent accepts another position, job rotation, submits a notice of retirement, etc.\) Slots opening sixty \(60\) days or less from the end of rotation will be assigned by Management.

For efficiency and to allow staff the longest possible opportunity to work in the available slot, Management may begin recruiting letters of interest prior to the slot actually being vacated. Should unforeseen circumstances cause the slot not to open up as anticipated, Management will simple rescind the recruitment \(or award\).

Management will request responses from interested staff by sending out an email to all Security staff. The recruitment will remain open for a minimum of seven \(7\) days and a close date will be specified.

The intent is to award the open shift and days off slot to the highest senior employee that submits their interest within the classification created by the vacancy. If no one in that classification submits interest, then management may make the open shift and days off opportunity available to other classifications if appropriate.

The assignment will be awarded to the staff member with the highest Bargaining Unit seniority using the seniority list effective on the close date of the recruitment notice.

Secondary Shift/Days Off slots that are vacated through the above process will be offered to interested staff using the same process. To minimize the “domino effect” back filling will stop after the third \(3rd\) staff member that is re-assigned as a result of the original vacancy \(i.e. the initial recruitment is \# one \(1\), back fill for them is \# two \(2\), back fill for the \# two \(2\) is the third \(3rd\) and final of the process\). Management will then use its right to assign to make any necessary adjustments to daily rosters to cover workload.

## Section 3 - Assignment of Overtime

_**This Section supersedes Article 15, Section 9.**_

1. The All Call \(Next Shift Only\). a. The All Call process will be available and applicable for all represented security employees comprised of the classifications of Sergeant, Corporal and Officer. b. When an unanticipated overtime opportunity occurs on the roster for vacancies in the next shift roster, the Officer in Charge \(OIC\) will announce a shift wide All Call via radio and as applicable via telephone to solicit for interested employees who would like to be considered for filling the slot. This will occur for all security employees working on that shift and who are able to be physically present when an overtime assignment is to begin. Any security employee working on a work crew, hospital watch or any other crew outside the institution will not be notified of the overtime assignment unless their shift ends before the start of the overtime assignment and they are able to be physically present for the start of the voluntary overtime assignment. However, any security employee working on a work crew, hospital watch or any other crew outside the institution will not be precluded from entering into a split shift arrangement with a co-worker to fill the back half of an overtime shift once they return to the institution. c. All staff will be provided at least a thirty \(30\) minute window of opportunity to respond. d. When management determines the need for overtime in a specific classification, management will assign the overtime opportunity to the employee with the highest AFSCME Security bargaining unit time in classification. First priority will be given to the classification of the employee who created the overtime assignment on the roster \(i.e., a Sergeant assignment opening will be assigned to the highest seniority Sergeant; Corporal to the highest seniority Corporal and Officer to the highest seniority Officer. Should no employee volunteer, the Agency will use the voluntary overtime list. e. Reasonable exceptions shall be authorized if management is notified with less than one \(1\) hour prior to the start of the next shift. In this case, an All Call will be given via radio and the Overtime will be awarded on a first come, first served basis. f. Overtime assignment for Hospital Watch will be made available for all DRCI Security employees that are currently assigned to Officer positions regardless of classification. Those assignments will be awarded to the highest total represented AFSCME Security bargaining unit time regardless of rank from those employees that volunteer.
2. The Voluntary Overtime List a. The Voluntary Overtime List will be the primary means of assigning Overtime and will be comprised of Sergeants, Corporals and Officers. b. This list will be a sign up sheet for Voluntary Overtime for the following month broken up by days and shifts. The Voluntary Overtime sign up List shall be placed in the Control Center seven \(7\) days prior to the start of the next month to provide reasonable opportunity for employees to indicate their availability and/or interest. The list shall be relocated to the OIC office at the start of each month and kept there for the remainder of the applicable time period. c. Additionally, employees will have access to a resource list of employees who are willing to be contacted by other employees to split an overtime shift. That list shall be kept together with the voluntary overtime list. Employees shall be responsible for securing another employee to work the other half of the shift or they will be responsible for working the entire shift. The accuracy of the list will not be subject to the grievance procedure. d. When management becomes aware of the need to fill a vacancy on the roster by assigning Overtime in advance, they will utilize the Voluntary Overtime list to offer the opportunity to the highest AFSCME bargaining unit time in classification on the specific day and/or shift. First priority will be given to the classification of the employee who has created the overtime assignment on the roster \(i.e., a Sergeant assignment opening will be assigned to the highest seniority Sergeant: Corporal to the highest seniority Corporal and Officer to the highest seniority Officer\). If no employee volunteers for the overtime, the overtime opportunity will be assigned to the employee with the highest AFSCME bargaining unit time regardless of classification. e. Management retains the right to assign, schedule and determine the processes for accomplishing work pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. f. Represented Security employees working in represented Job Rotation or Work Out of Classification assignments outside of the DRCI Local 745 will not be eligible to sign up on the voluntary overtime list. Except for instances where no other volunteers are available, these employees may volunteer to work overtime with the supervisor’s advance approval. g. Voluntary overtime may be denied for valid cause.
3. The Mandatory Overtime List

a. There will be two \(2\) Mandatory Overtime Lists. The first list shall be comprised of all Sergeants and all Corporals and the second list will be comprised of all Officers. If the Institution exhausts a security unit mandatory overtime list and there is still no employees who can work mandatory overtime, the Institution will then use the other security unit mandatory overtime list available to fill the assignment\(s\).

b. The applicable Mandatory Overtime List\(s\) will be used only after the Voluntary Overtime List and the All Call process has been exhausted and management has failed to find a volunteer to fill a required slot.

c. The Mandatory Overtime Lists shall be created at the start of each shift bid rotation and shall be in Inverse seniority order defined by total AFSCME bargaining unit time.

d. The OIC will review and maintain the Mandatory Overtime Lists on each shift. The OIC shall notify the top two \(2\) Officers and the top one \(1\) of the Corporal/Sergeants on the respective Mandatory Overtime Lists who are at work at the start of each shift.

e. Staff moves to the bottom of the mandatory overtime list when any of the following circumstances occur:

1. They have reached number one \(1\) on the list and either were subsequently notified or assigned mandatory overtime or they were not required to work mandatory overtime.
2. They volunteered and worked three and a half \(3.5\) hours or more of Overtime.
3. They volunteer for the next shift and work three and a half \(3.5\) or more hours of voluntary overtime.
4. When they find another employee to act as a replacement for their mandatory overtime shift.

f. Exceptions to being bucketed or assigned mandatory overtime include:

1. Employees shall not be placed on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List on any day preceding their scheduled days off \(their ‘Friday’\), the day before a scheduled bid vacation period, or a previously approved vacation or sick leave day off. 
2. Those employees who are working a trade comprised of two consecutive shifts \(a double\).
3. Those employees who are on their first day back from scheduled vacation or their last day prior to their scheduled trades which are adjacent to their scheduled vacation or three \(3\) or more consecutive trade days off.
4. An employee who is unable to bid on a voluntary overtime assignment due to being on a work crew, hospital watch or any other crew outside the institution will not be bucketed for that respective day.

g. No employee shall be required to work more than sixteen \(16\) hours of overtime per week unless there is an emergency or valid cause.

## Section 4 - Hospital Watch Meals

a. DOC will work with hospitals or medical centers to make billing arrangements where an employee who works an eight \(8\) hour shift will be eligible to receive one \(1\) meal not to exceed eight dollars \($8.00\).

b. First \(1st\) shift staff may call ahead and have the Officer on duty order a meal for them prior to the Medical Facilities kitchen closing.
