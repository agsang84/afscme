# 25 - Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution

## Bidding Process

a. All security posts, except those specified as exempt, shall be included in the bid system with seniority prevailing.

b. All security section posts not exempt shall have an established rotation period of six \(6\) months as existed on July 1, 2001. A rotation period can be changed to three \(3\) months at the discretion of the Institution, however the Union can grieve the reasonableness of the decision under paragraph e below. The mechanics of the bidding procedure shall be determined by the Agency. The affected post shall then be assigned to the senior employee placing a bid, and such employee must remain on such post until the next rotation date occurs. All affected employees must bid each time their respective post rotates. An employee cannot use seniority to secure a post for more than two \(2\) consecutive bids nor use seniority to secure a bid for the same post during a two \(2\)-year period. Seniority will prevail on every bid, but the post an employee may bid by seniority will vary as per above. An employee who has not successfully bid a post or an employee who did not bid a post may be assigned by the Institution until such employee is able to make a successful bid.

c. A senior employee may be denied or removed from a post for valid cause only.

d. If an employee is assigned for Institution convenience to an exempt post herein specified, the Institution will provide adequate training prior to assignment. The posts exempt from bidding are:

* Control Relief-One Year Post \(must rotate out for six months before returning\)
* Control Center Staff on All Shifts
* Tool and Key Sergeant Post
  * Two \(2\) Year Exempt
  * 241-2
* Assignment Office
* Segregation Property Officer

Control Center Officers must rotate after one \(1\) year, but Control Center staff will not rotate out at the same time. Rotations shall be staggered to ensure that an experienced staff member is working in Control at all times. All exempt posts listed above shall be held for a maximum period of one \(1\) year, with the exception of Tool and Key, at which time the incumbent Officer must return to a bid position. Incumbent exempt post Sergeants may bid into another post or apply for another exempt post. In the event of circumstances beyond the control of the Institution, management may temporarily hold an employee in one \(1\) of these positions not to exceed six \(6\) months.

e. The Recreation Sergeant \(Post \#62-2\) and the Inmate Activities Officer \(Post \#205-2\), both on second shift, will be one \(1\) year bid posts. In an effort to ensure continuity, these posts will not rotate on the same bid cycle whenever possible.

f. The following posts will be designated as Training Posts:  


| First Shift  | Second Shift |
| --- | --- |
| RDO 9 \(F3, F4, G2\) / Flex 1 / Flex 4 | RDO 17 \(B1, B2, A4\) / Flex 22 / Flex 23 / Flex 24 |

Should the Oregon Department of Corrections implement a security hiring freeze, all of the above posts will be available for Seniority bid for the following, and any subsequent Post Bid Rotation as long as the security hiring freeze remains in effect. No employee on initial trial service will be placed in an armed post.

g. When a Bid Post becomes open for a reason such as retirement, promotion or transfer, it will be filled by seniority, or by being made available to the person next in seniority who desires it by memorandum of interest. This process will be completed within thirty \(30\) days of a Bid Post vacancy. This process does not include Exempt Posts and will not apply to Bid Posts which become vacant as a result of this process. When an employee receives a memo post, the employee cannot memo into another post during that bid cycle.

h. Should the institution wish to remove a security post from the bid list or wish to establish a post outside the bid list, notice will be given to the Union. If the Union believes the specified removal to be unreasonable, then within seven \(7\) days of the date upon which the Union knows, or by reasonable diligence, should have known of the subject action, the Union shall request the Institution meet to discuss the issue. Failure to reach agreement on the disputed post shall allow the Union to proceed to arbitration under the provisions of Article 1, Section 5. Timelines established in Article 1, Section 5 shall apply to meetings and appeals under this section.

i. Work Schedules. Schedules showing each employee's shift, workdays, and hours shall be posted in the appropriate department at all times. Changes in work schedules, from shift to shift, may occur for valid cause or as mutually agreed.

j. Employees who extend their bid for a back-to-back assignment may not use their seniority to bid the same assignment until two \(2\) years from the date they were scheduled to vacate the post. Where an employee gets bumped from their current post, the employee may bid the post again, but can’t bid the post more than twice in a two \(2\) year period.

k. Transfers. When a staff member transfers into Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution with the same date of hire as an existing staff member, the existing staff member shall be granted the higher seniority within the classification.

l. Employees may work in Disciplinary Segregation Unit for up to two \(2\) years but must rotate out for no less than six \(6\) months before returning.

m. The Union shall be notified of any special assignments within the institution prior to implementation.

n. All posts not specified as exempt will be bid posts and any posts that are left open from the bid can be assigned as training posts.

o. Time trades shall be completed within a ninety \(90\) day time period as per Section 7 time Trades of the General Article 25. If both dates fall within the same bid rotation, the time limit will be extended to up to one hundred eighty days \(180\).

p. Before the Institution implements its contingency plan related to the addition of emergency beds, the institution will notify the local union president and provide the opportunity to discuss and offer input.

q. Security staff who bid a five \(5\) day a week or a relief armed observation tower post \(Post \#77-2, 78-2, 77-3, 78-3, RDO 13-2 and RDO 33-3\) will be assigned a mini 14 scoped rifle at the start of each rotation. Each mini 14 will be properly sighted in by a qualified range master prior to assignment and rechecked monthly.

r. After employees successfully bid their posts per Article 25 \(EOCI\), or failing to successfully bid, are assigned a post, the following conditions apply:

1. Change in Shift/Days Off a. The Security Manager or designee may change an employee’s shift and days off for valid cause only. When practical, the employee shall receive a seven \(7\) day notice of change. b. If the employee believes the change of bid shift and days off was not for valid cause, the employee may appeal the decision to the Labor/Management Resolution Committee. c. Should the Committee determine that a change of shift and days off was not for valid cause, the employee shall receive RFM differential for the entire period of the assignment. d. The decision of this committee will be final and binding on both Parties. 
2. Change in Job Assignment a. The Employer retains the right and discretion to change an employee’s job assignment within the employee’s bid shift/days off. However, employees may not be removed from bid fixed posts within their shift, except for valid cause. If an employee is so removed, the employee may request review following the chain of command \(i.e. shift lieutenant, captain, security manager and assistant superintendent\). If the matter is not resolved, the employee may refer the matter to the Labor/Management Resolution Committee. b. Should the committee determine that this change of assignment is not valid cause, the superintendent shall take appropriate action as necessary. 
3. Labor/Management Resolution Committee. The above Labor/Management Resolution Committee shall consist of five \(5\) members. Two \(2\) management members will be selected by the AFSCME Council 75 representing. Two \(2\) Labor members will be selected by the DAS Labor Relations Manager. The Superintendent will be a permanent member of the committee. The decisions of this committee are final and binding on both Parties and can’t be pursued through the grievance procedure.

s. The Institution will attempt to ensure that staff who bid flex will be left on their bid shift and days off the week of vacation and the week following.

## Overtime Assignments

### a. Process of Assignments

When there is a need for overtime work, the following steps will be followed:

1. The weekly overtime list will be given first \(1st\) priority to fill any overtime. 
2. Daily overtime list will be assigned second \(2nd\) priority to fill any overtime assignments. As with voluntary overtime, Sergeant posts will be filled by Sergeants/Corporals first \(1st\) and Officer posts will be filled by Officers first \(1st\). The first \(1st\) staff on the list will have the first \(1st\) pick of available posts. The second \(2nd\) staff on the list will have second \(2nd\) pick of the available posts and so on until all posts are filled. 
3. On the job training Officers \(OJT\) can be pulled from their assigned post and placed in another post in order to allow the post to be used to fill an overtime assignment that other staff may want to work. 
4. Staff assigned as ‘Flex’ can be pulled from their assigned posts and placed in another post in order to allow the post to be used to fill an overtime opportunity that other staff may want to work. 
5. Corrections Officers, Corporals and Sergeants can voluntarily relinquish his/her post and be placed in another post in order to allow the post to be filled by another staff member. 
6. Corrections Officers may trade with Corporals and Sergeants provided they are qualified to perform the duties. \(Any MOT assignments do not matter\). 
7. Correctional Officers cannot be assigned to work as a Corporal or Sergeant when there is MOT \(except for number 6 above\). 
8. When there is sufficient staff available to work overtime on a shift, staff will be sent home in the following order \(the last staff assigned will be the first \(1st\) staff relieved in each category’s below\): 
   1. Employees assigned mandatory overtime; 
   2. Employees from solicited overtime; 
   3. Employees assigned overtime from the daily overtime signup; 
   4. Employees on the weekly overtime signup.

### b. Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket Procedure\)

The updated bucket list will be maintained on the computer.

The OIC or AOIC is the person responsible to update the Bucket List, and will confirm the identity of the bucket person for their shift within one hour of the beginning of their shift. In the event that more than one person is needed, the OIC or AOIC will notify the second bucket staff as soon as number one is assigned. The OIC or AOIC will record the appropriate information on the bucket list immediately following Roll Call and at the end of their shift when necessary.

1st Shift OIC will determine the 1st Shift bucket and 6:10 a.m. – 2:40 p.m. bucket.

2nd Shift OIC or AOIC will determine the 2nd Shift bucket.

3rd Shift OIC or AOIC will determine the 3rd Shift bucket \(the 2:30 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. and 4:10 p.m. – 12:10 a.m. bucket lists have been combined\).

In an effort to allow staff the opportunity to better control when they work overtime, staff that volunteer to work overtime will have that date placed in their column to count as their bucket day. If two \(2\) or more staff have the same bucket day, then the staff that last worked overtime will be placed at the bottom of the list for that day unless the Institution needs a staff member who is APQ qualified. This will serve the same purpose as if they had been placed into the bucket on that day.

As such, they will not be considered for the bucket again until all others have had their turn in the bucket.

This applies to staff that sign up for overtime and are not needed. This does not apply to the hospital watch sign-up when available. When volunteering as a result of solicitation, no minimum time worked is required.

Flex staff assigned to long term assignments \(two \(2\) or more weeks in a row\) will receive notice seven \(7\) days in advance of their assignment. They will be exempt from being assigned in the bucket list the first \(1st\) seven \(7\) day period of the assignment. When Flex staff is returned to his/her bid post, he/she will be eligible for the bucket list.

Staff will not be placed into the bucket on their Friday or the day prior to a scheduled vacation day, or the day before or after their vacation. If a staff member is notified they are in the bucket, and one of these situations apply, they will notify the OIC or AOIC within one hour so they can be removed from the bucket and the next person can be notified.

It is the responsibility of the OIC or AOIC to contact the staff as early as possible in their shift when the staff will be required to work mandatory overtime.

A volunteer overtime list shall be developed and maintained on a daily basis by the OIC or AOIC. This list will be on a first come, first served basis. This will not count towards the bucket if no work is available. If an employee volunteers for an overtime opportunity and:

1. Within two \(2\) hours before the actual overtime opportunity is to start the employee notifies the Institution he/she will not work, and, 
2. Where such notice requires the institution to assign an employee mandatory overtime for that post, and, 
3. There is no bona fide emergency or no OFLA/FMLA qualifying event, then, 
4. The employee not working the voluntary overtime will not be assigned voluntary overtime for thirty \(30\) calendar days from the date of notice.

When a shift change occurs, the date of the staff member’s last bucket day, regardless of their previous shift will be transferred to the new list.

The OIC or AOIC will make a reasonable attempt to contact all staff on shift to solicit overtime. When it is discovered that a staff member will be held MOT, the OIC or AOIC will make a radio announcement to all staff, and a phone call to DSU soliciting OT due to the use of a bucket.

One hour is the minimum amount of time required to work overtime to qualify for the bucket list exemption. This will include institutional emergencies \(lock downs\) and hospital watch. Time in training and attending Institution meetings will not count toward the bucket list exemption.

A staff member is accountable to the bucket until the end of their scheduled shift.

Staff will only be held in the bucket within their job classification, unless there are no reasonable alternatives. Corporals will be considered the same classification as Sergeants for the bucket list.

When updating the bucket list, a color system will be used. Black will indicate bucket day, red indicates MOT, and blue indicates VOT.

### C. Voluntary Overtime \(Overtime Sign-up\)

* The overtime sign-up rotates shifts in order for every shift to have the first opportunity to sign up. Therefore, staff who bid the shift the sign-up is on will have first priority for thirty \(30\) minutes.
* It is the responsibility of the OIC or AOIC to contact staff who have signed up for overtime if that staff member will not be needed. This contact must be made at least six \(6\) hours prior to the start of the scheduled shift, to account for travel and prep time. If unforeseen events create the need for less than six \(6\) hours notice, then the employee will be offered placement at the top of the daily overtime list. If more than one employee is canceled they will be placed on the daily overtime list in seniority order. If called in, the employee\(s\) shall be offered the choice of the original planned overtime post or the other vacancy.
* The OIC or AOIC will use the updated contact number on file. If a staff member will not be available to receive this call, they must contact the OIC or AOIC prior to reporting for work.
* When a staff member signs up for overtime in a classification other than theirs, they are subject to being “bumped” by a staff of that classification up to 48-hours prior to the scheduled shift. For this purpose, Corporal and Sergeants are considered to be in the same classification.
* The OIC or AOIC in control of the sign-up will notify the staff that has been bumped by phone and Institution email.

For purposes of planned overtime, if a Flex is assigned to work a shift, other than their bid shift, for more than five \(5\) days they will be considered as bidding that shift.
