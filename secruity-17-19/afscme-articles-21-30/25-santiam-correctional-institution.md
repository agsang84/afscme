# 25 - Santiam Correctional Institution

Employees who have completed initial trial service may bid shift and days off in order of seniority as defined in Section 9 of this Article. Employees, who fail to successfully bid, or who do not apply or bid, will be assigned at the discretion of the Institution's Management.

Bids will address shift and days off and potential assignments. Bidding will occur every six \(6\) months, becoming effective on the first Sunday of March and September. The Security Manager will post all available shift and days off bid positions at least thirty \(30\) calendar days prior to the rotation date.

The mechanics of the bidding procedure will be determined at labor/management. All bids must be in writing, signed by the bidding employee, and numbered by preference, if placing more than one \(1\) bid. The results of the bids will be arranged into the master roster template that generates the daily work schedules and will be posted no less than seven \(7\) calendar days prior to the rotation date.

Three \(3\) shift and day off assignments may be designated as exempt for training as needed. The Tool and Key Control Corporal shall be designated as an exempt post.

The Institution's Management may only remove or deny an employee from a daily work schedule for valid cause.

## Voluntary Overtime

a. Employees are encouraged to sign up for voluntary overtime in advance of its occurrence to facilitate planning. The Agency will maintain voluntary overtime lists upon which employees may designate their eligibility in writing. Thirty days of overtime list will be made available to employees for each shift and then in the Lieutenant’s office. Employees will indicate if they are available to volunteer for overtime during the period\(s\) covered by the voluntary overtime list\(s\). Employees may also indicate which days and shifts they will be available to work. The Agency may begin assigning people from the voluntary overtime list one \(1\) workday or twenty-four \(24\) hours prior to the shift being assigned. Employees may continue to sign up for overtime after this time, but may not displace an assignment once it is made. Once the employee has worked or declined an overtime opportunity, they will be moved to the bottom of the voluntary overtime list. If the Agency determines there is a need for overtime on any shift the overtime will be first offered to the employees who are signed up on the voluntary overtime list. All employees on the voluntary overtime list will be rotated once they have accepted, worked or declined a voluntary overtime opportunity. Once the employee has accepted, worked or declined a voluntary overtime opportunity, they will be moved to the bottom of the voluntary overtime list. If the employees signed up on the voluntary overtime list are not interested in the overtime, or if there is a valid reason for denial of the opportunity to those employees, then the employer will make the overtime opportunity available to other post qualified employees on shift who didn’t sign up on the voluntary overtime list.

b. Once an employee has worked one \(1\) hour or more of voluntary overtime they will be move to the bottom of the voluntary overtime list. A staff member cannot work or be assigned another overtime until everyone on the voluntary list has had an opportunity to work an overtime shift. If a staff member works or declines an overtime assignment; it will still serve as an afforded opportunity to work. In all cases where a staff had a voluntary overtime opportunity they will be rotated to the bottom of the voluntary list.

c. Employees have to be qualified to perform the overtime work. Correctional Officer Series employees have to have either the experience or the ability to be able to perform the specialized security tasks.

d. If circumstances require a short extension of the shift to complete a task, the Agency may involuntary require the effected employee\(s\) to stay and finish the assignment. Such extensions shall not affect the employee’s placement on the mandatory overtime list unless the employee is required to work one \(1\) hour or more.

## Mandatory Overtime:

a. The Agency will announce the top three \(3\) employees who are on the mandatory overtime list within one \(1\) hour of the start of the shift. When an overtime opportunity arises and management is unable to find a volunteer to fill that assignment, the Agency may draft employees for the overtime opportunity from a mandatory overtime list on a rotating basis of last overtime worked and based on inverse classification seniority. Any overtime of one \(1\) hour or more will move the affected employee to the bottom of the mandatory overtime list. Staff will not be required to work mandatory overtime on their Friday, their scheduled days off, or if they have already worked an overtime assignment within the previous twenty-four \(24\) hours, except during periods of declared emergency. Prior to holding staff for mandatory overtime, an announcement will be made by the OIC over the Institution radio asking for any volunteers for the open post.

b. A list of staff that may be willing to work a split shift in the event another staff member is held for mandatory overtime shall be established. This will be an ongoing list and need not be signed every day. The list will be kept on the end of the voluntary overtime board. It will be the responsibility of the staff wishing to split a shift to add or remove their name to the list. When they sign the list they will indicate the half shift\(s\) they are willing to work. When a staff member is held for mandatory overtime, they can, at their choice ask the OIC for the names of the staff on the voluntary overtime split list. It is then their responsibility to contact the control center at an appropriate time and have them contact the employee. Control center will then forward the call to the on duty staff. If a staff member is found for the split the OIC will be notified immediately and he or she will make the change to the roster. If the second staff member does not report for the part of the shift they are to work, the staff member on mandatory overtime will be required to finish the shift.

### c. Meals During Overtime:

Employees working four \(4\) hours or more beyond the employee’s regular shift will receive a meal ticket. Only one \(1\) employee is entitled to a meal ticket when two \(2\) or more staff split an overtime shift.

### d. Splitting Overtime Shifts:

1. Employees can split both voluntary and mandatory overtime assignments. No more than three \(3\) staff members can split a shift. 
2. A list of staff who are willing to work a split overtime shift shall be maintained by the OIC. This will be an ongoing list and need not be signed every day. The list will be kept on the voluntary overtime board. 
3. It will be the responsibility of the employee wishing to split a shift to add or remove their name from the list. When they sign the list, they will indicate half shifts they will be willing to work. 
4. When a staff member is held for overtime, they can ask, at their choice, the OIC for the names of the staff on the overtime split list. It is then their responsibility to contact the Control Center and have them contact the employee. The Control Center will then forward the call to the on duty staff member. 
5. If staff member\(s\) is found for the split, the OIC will be notified immediately. If any staff member does not report to work, the staff member will be required to finish the shift. 
6. The employee initiating the split voluntary overtime shift request shall work at least one \(1\) hour of the overtime.

## Filling of Open Post Guidelines:

An open post is defined as a post that becomes open between bid cycles because the person resigned, transferred, promoted, was approved for long term medical leave, military deployment, work out of class or a new work crew assignment is established.

Any open post that will be vacant for more than ninety \(90\) days the ISM will use the following process to fill the position:

* The ISDS Coordinator will send an email to all security staff and will identify the classification, post, shift, days off and the SSD \(Security Seniority Date\) of the vacating staff.
* Staff in the assigned classification will respond within seven \(7\) days with a Memo of Interest.
* Any open posts will first \(1st\) be offered to employees with an SSD below the vacating staff member’s SSD. Seniority will apply starting with the staff member immediately below the vacated post.
* This process will continue until no further request to fill the subsequent open posts in that classification occurs.
* If the employee who created the open post returns unexpectedly during the bid cycle they will retain their bid position and any employee who changed positions during the bid cycle will return to their original bid position.

Any open post that occurs during a bid cycle and the opening is expected to last less than ninety \(90\) days; the position will be filled using the daily fill process.

Secondary shift/days off slots that are vacated through the above process will be offered to interested staff using the same process. To minimize the ‘domino effect’ back filling will stop after the second \(2nd\) staff member that is reassigned as a result of the original vacancy unless the subsequent vacancy is attached to a weekend. Management will then use its right to assign to make any necessary adjustments to daily rosters to cover workload.

## Filling of Fire Crew Positions:

The procedure for assigning personnel to the temporary fire crew\(s\) dispatched from Santiam Correctional Institution \(SCI\) during the yearly fire season or in the event of a natural disaster is as follows:

The Agency will notify employees of the opportunity to volunteer for fire camp and natural disaster support in writing once a year. A voluntary fire crew list will be made available and posted for volunteers to sign up. Fire camp and fire crew duties are voluntary assignments and by volunteering, the employee agrees to deviate from his/her normal work schedule without advanced notice. The employee additionally understands and waives [**Article 15 – Overtime Section 3**](../afscme-articles-11-20.md#section-3-shift-change-penalty) Shift Change Penalty does not apply.

The Agency will select from a list of volunteers who have signed up in advance and have been organized based upon seniority date as defined in [**Article 25 Working Conditions Section 8 Seniority**](./#section-8-seniority). The employee cannot have any pending shift trades at the time of assignment. If so, the Agency will go to the next person on the list. The hiring of fire crew staff will follow the same rotation process as hiring of staff for voluntary overtime under subsection \(b\).

Standard length of assignment and other guidelines will be according to [**Article 55 - Fire Assignments**](../afscme-article-51-56.md#article-55-fire-assignments). However, upon completion of the standard fourteen \(14\) day assignment the employee will be replaced by the next eligible employee that is signed upon the voluntary signup sheet. If the list is depleted, then the Agency will revert to the top of the list and repeat the process.
