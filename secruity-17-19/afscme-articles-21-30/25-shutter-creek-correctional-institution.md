## Section 1 - Shift / Days Off Bidding

a. Employees who have completed initial trial service may bid shifts and days off in order of seniority as defined in Section 8 of this Article.

b. Bids will address only shift and days off. The institution’s management will make the specific daily work assignments and may remove an employee from any work assignment for valid cause.

c. Employees who fail to successfully bid or who do not bid will be assigned at the discretion of the institution’s management.

d. Bidding will occur every six \(6\) months, becoming effective on the first \(1st\) Sunday of April and October. The Security Manager shall post work schedules thirty \(30\) calendar days before the rotation date. Employees shall have ten \(10\) calendar days following the posting of the work schedules to place bids.

e. The Parties will agree upon a process of bidding based on scheduled appointments and current bid status. The new assignment schedule will be posted no less than seven \(7\) calendar days prior to the effective date.

f. The Employer agrees that as long as final ERB order on Remand for UP-33-03 issued July 23, 2009 is settled case law, the Employer will bargain, upon demand, changes to eight \(8\) or ten \(10\) hour start/stop times for shifts.

## Section 2 - Mid Shift Rotation Bid Assignment Process

a. If a shift / days off slot is vacated during a shift bid rotation, the following procedure will be used:

1. Institution management will post the vacant slot within seven \(7\) calendar days from the date the Institution management receives notice of an employee vacating the slot. 
2. The vacant slot will be posted by email to all security staff employees for at least seven \(7\) calendar days with a specific close date after the Institution receives notice the slot will be vacated as a result of the current employee’s resignation, submits retirement notice, transfer, promotion, demotion or death.
3. Institution management will assign the most senior employee to the vacant slot who has the same classification as the slot that has been vacated. Seniority shall be applied under [**Article 25, Section 8**](./#section-8-seniority) of this Agreement. 
4. If, after seven \(7\) calendar days after the close of the posting, no employee has bid for the slot, Institution management may assign the vacant slot to another employee or choose not to fill the slot. 
5. An employee may only be granted one \(1\) reassignment under this section per shift / days off rotation. 
6. Notwithstanding the above, slots opened ninety \(90\) calendar days or less from the end of the rotation will be assigned by Institution management if the Institution plans to fill the slot. 
7. If the slot is not vacated as anticipated, Institution management will rescind the posting.

b. If the Institution chooses to fill the remaining slot, the Institution will follow the above process and offer the secondary shift / days off slot that are vacated to interested security staff using the same process in subsection \(a\) of this section to minimize the “domino effect” back filling will stop the second \(2nd\) staff member reassigned as a result of the original vacant slot.
