# 25 - Snake River Correctional Institution

## Section 1

Work Schedule Bidding. Each security staff member may submit their bid for a shift and days off work schedule following the posting of the work schedule by the Assistant Superintendent of Security or designee. Employees shall have ten \(10\) working days following the posting of the work schedule to make their bid selections. The employer will post the work schedule for bidding twenty-five \(25\) calendar days prior to the rotation date.

Security staff may submit three \(3\) selections. Such selections must be submitted in priority order. Officers who have completed trial service may bid shifts and days off in order of seniority as defined in [**Section 8**](./#section-8-seniority) of this Article. Employees who fail to successfully bid, or who do not apply for bid, will be assigned at the discretion of the Assistant Superintendent of Security or designee. Security staff hired in between bid periods will be assigned by the Assistant Superintendent of Security or designee.

Security staff will bid every six \(6\) months for rotation effective the first \(1st\) Sunday of October and April.

If an employee has completed trial service before the rotation date, the employee will be eligible to bid by seniority as defined in [**Section 8**](./#section-8-seniority) of this Article.

In the event staff members cannot bid for themselves, they may elect a proxy to place their bid for them. At the assigned bid time, the proxy must produce the official proxy form, signed by the person for whom they are bidding.

Staff may choose to defer their bid in order to bid with another person. In that instance, both staff members will bid at the time assigned to the lower senior person of the two.

Any staff member who misses their bid window will be afforded the opportunity to bid between the next available time slots after reporting to bid. However, they will not be allowed to bump another staff member from a posted bid. No bids will be accepted after the last time slot available to bid.

All bids are final, staff will be expected to work the shift and day off schedule they have selected.

At the conclusion of the workday, bids will be posted outside the Staff Deployment Office throughout the bid process in order to ensure staff will have the most current information available for placing their bid. An electronic copy will also be made available to the Union designee so that it can be posted on the computer system.

## Section 2 - Critical Incident Trauma Management Assignments.

If an assignment becomes available, the institution will post the opportunity for no less than five \(5\) calendar days. The agency will determine the method of selection and determine the individuals to fill the assignment.

## Section 3 - Fire Crew Assignments.

a. Crew members assigned during the prior fire season will be assigned to work a subsequent new fire season except when:

1. staffing requirements are substantially different from the prior fire season; 
2. budgeted funds are not available; 
3. the employee separates from the SRCI Security local or Agency service; 
4. where the employee has identified performance deficiencies/misconduct; 
5. the employee chooses not to work the fire assignment; 
6. the employee is unable to carry out assigned responsibility due to an injury or unable to pass the pre-seasonal “Pack Test”; 
7. employees returning from approved leaves \(Military/FMLA/OFLA\) will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by Management to determine eligibility for the current season. Once these employees are identified to work fire assignments, the Parties will determine the distribution of the fire assignments and review the training/testing requirements.

b. **Filling Assignment Opportunities:**

When there is a need to assign new or different staff, the Agency will publicize the assignment opportunity and distribute an email to all SRCI represented employees \(via the DOC email system\), notifying them of the opening\(s\). Postings will be for a minimum of ten \(10\) calendar days in order to give employees an opportunity to apply for the vacant position\(s\). After consulting with the Union, the Agency will determine the examination process to follow and select the employees for the assignments. If an employee is a candidate for the fire crew, and the interviews include examination questions regarding Agency policies, the Agency will list the policies, procedures and rules that may be covered in the interview.

Fire Crew candidates that are not currently fire crew assigned but possess the training required by ODF will be included in the selection process.

## Section 4 - Distribution of Mandatory and Voluntary Overtime.

The Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List

1. A mandatory overtime \(bucket\) list will be created to include all represented employees with the exception of those employees exempt from overtime. 
2. The Employer shall create three \(3\) separate Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) Lists, following each semi-annual bid rotation. These separate lists shall be maintained by the basic shifts. The lists that will be created are: a. First Shift - Includes all shifts beginning after 10:00 PM each day and ending by 9:00 AM the following day. b. Second Shift – Includes all shifts beginning after 5:00 AM and ending prior to 6:00 PM. c. Third Shift – Includes all shifts beginning after 10:00 AM and ending prior to 1:00 AM. 
3. Employee’s names will appear on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List in alphabetical order from A to Z. a. Employees added to the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List during the rotation period shall have their names added to the computerized list in alphabetical order. 
4. The Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List will be updated each shift by the Officer-in-Charge \(OIC\) \(Lieutenant or Working Out of Class Lieutenant\). Two \(2\) lists shall be maintained. The OIC \(Lieutenant or Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) shall maintain the primary list in the OIC’s \(Lieutenant or Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) office. The primary list will be used to settle any and all disputes. A secondary list for informational purposes only shall be posted in a glass encased bulletin board in the Master Control and Staff Deployment hallway. The OIC \(Lieutenant or Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) will attempt to update the secondary list by the first \(1st\) shift and the list will be made available to staff so they can see their approximate position on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List. 
5. For each shift the OIC \(Lieutenant or Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) shall publish, via the electronic shift briefing and “Sally port’ Information portal, the top three \(3\) Sergeants/Corporals and the top ten \(10\) Correctional Officers who will be on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List for that shift. a. Corporals and Sergeants will be considered one \(1\) classification for the purposes of filling vacancies using the Voluntary Overtime and Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List. 
6. An employee shall receive credit \(date placed by their name\) on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List as follows:  


   a. Being assigned by the OIC \(Lieutenant or Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) to work any part of the following shift on mandatory overtime.  
  
   b. Being relieved late on post that results in the employee being paid overtime.  
  
   c. Being listed as number one \(1\) on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List for the day regardless if you worked overtime the following shift or not.  

7. The only employee who shall receive credit for being number one \(1\) on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List and not working overtime is the person in the number one \(1\) spot at the beginning of the shift and completes their regular shift and was not required to work mandatory overtime.

d. Being assigned Voluntary Overtime when signed up on the Voluntary On-shift Overtime list and being one of the top three \(3\) Sergeants/Corporals or top ten \(10\) Correctional Officers on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List. If the employee who is on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List is working an employee agreed upon “split-shift”, that employee will be required to work a minimum of two \(2\) hours of voluntary overtime in order to receive credit for the mandatory overtime list.

e. After an employee returns from pre-approved leave \(excluding time trades\) that is fifteen \(15\) calendar days or more and their name reaches number one \(1\) on the computerized mandatory overtime list, they will be considered to have caught up and not be required to make up missed overtime obligations.

1. Exemptions from Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List:  a. Employees who are on Modified or Light Duty are not permitted to work overtime are therefore exempted from being placed on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List.  b. Employees once cleared for full duty shall have their name placed back on the mandatory overtime list.  c. Employee’s who are scheduled to attend agency training or other approved training, are exempt from being on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List when doing so would not allow the employee to have eight \(8\) consecutive hours off duty prior to the training. 
2. This applies only for the day or days attending training.

d. Employee shall not be placed on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List on any day preceding their scheduled days off \(their “Friday”\) or the day before a scheduled bid vacation period or a previously approved vacation day off.

e. Employees shall not be placed on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List on any day preceding a full eight \(8\) hour scheduled sick leave day that has been previously requested and approved by Staff Deployment.

f. Employee Time Trades:

1. Employees who are scheduled to work a time trade on the following shift or a shift on the following day will be exempt from the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List.
2. Employees shall not be placed on the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List if working mandatory overtime prevents the employee from having less than eight \(8\) consecutive hours of time off duty before their next scheduled shift or working an approved traded shift.
3. Employees can be placed on mandatory overtime on a day preceding a “trade day off”.
4. An employee list will be developed and maintained in Master Control of employees that would like to be called at home. It will be the responsibility of these employees to indicate what specific shifts and days they are available to be contacted when an employee has been assigned a mandatory overtime.
5. It will be the responsibility of the employee being assigned a mandatory overtime \(bucketed\) to contact Master Control Staff to initiate and contact only those employees at home who have indicated they are available for overtime for specific shifts and days.
6. Employees will be required to work mandatory overtime when assigned.
7. If a mandatory overtime position is no longer needed during a shift, the last staff mandatoried \(bucketed\) will be the first offered to be relieved.

### On-Shift Voluntary Overtime

The intent of this section is to distribute overtime in a consistent and equitable manner.

A Voluntary Overtime list, one \(1\) for each shift, will be created by ISDS to include all represented employees \(with the exception of those employees exempt from overtime\) at the beginning of each rotation. Employees added to the Voluntary Overtime List during the rotation period shall have their names added to the computerized list.

1. The Officer-In-Charge \(OIC\) \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) shall post Voluntary Overtime Sign-up sheets seven \(7\) days in advance. These sheets will be consistent with the documents currently in use for roster management. These rosters will generally be available at major shift change times. If the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) is unavailable, then the employee will have to wait to sign up. Employees can only sign themselves up on the On Shift Voluntary Overtime List and are not allowed to sign up other employee names.
2. If an employee volunteers and is offered overtime and refuses, the employee will be credited as if the employee had worked the overtime.
3. In preparing the following shift’s roster, the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) will know how many positions will need to be filled with overtime and then generate a list of available overtime positions. At the time of an overtime offer, the OIC will offer all available overtime posts to each staff member in successive order of the Voluntary Overtime List for which the employee is qualified to work.
4. Using the Voluntary Overtime List. The OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) shall offer overtime to the staff on the Voluntary Overtime list in alphabetical order, in the same order as the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List for that day. Employees having the least credits on the Voluntary Overtime List will first \(1st\) be offered the overtime.
5. The OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) shall prepare the next shifts roster at their convenience based on their workload and time available. If the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) offers an employee on the Voluntary List an overtime position and they accept or decline it, and another position becomes available later, the initial overtime assignment or rejection stands An employee will not be moved from a post assignment solely for the purpose of making an overtime assignment more desirable.
6. The OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) shall continue down the voluntary list alphabetically until the list is exhausted.
7. The OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) will then have an All Call announcement made, announcing overtime positions are available.
8. After exhausting the Voluntary Overtime List and conducting the Institution “All Call” for the vacant positions, the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) shall resort to the Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List to fill the positions needed.
9. Any employee accepting an overtime assignment using the On Shift Voluntary Overtime List that is two \(2\) hours or more in duration shall receive “credit” for working overtime on the Voluntary Overtime List, by having the date that they worked overtime written next to their name on the list.

> NOTE: Employees working overtime who are called from home OR who agree to work a split, will be credited on the Voluntary Overtime List.

1. Out-Of-Classification Overtime Assignments: a. Once the Corporal/Sergeant On Shift Voluntary Overtime List has been exhausted and an “All-Call” has been made announcing the Corporal/Sergeant overtime position available, the vacant Corporal/Sergeant position can be offered to the next Correctional Officer on the On Shift Voluntary Overtime List as long as the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) determines that the Officer is qualified to fulfill the duties of that post. b. Officers will not be used to fill a Corporal or Sergeant position when officers are being placed on mandatory overtime in their own classification. If this happens, a Corporal or a Sergeant will be assigned to fill the position with mandatory overtime. c. Corporals and Sergeants can be used to fill vacant officer positions on overtime prior to using the Officer Mandatory Overtime \(Bucket\) List, as long as the Officer’s On Shift Voluntary List has been exhausted.
2. Employee Agreed Upon “Split Shifts” – An employee who successfully obtains an overtime assignment as a result of this Agreement can agree with another employee to split part of that shift. The other employee must be able to fulfill the duties of that post and must be otherwise available to work in an overtime capacity \(not light/modified duty\). On split shifts employees will agree to work a minimum of two \(2\) hours of overtime unless ‘mandatoried’.
3. All overtime is subject to cancellation at anytime by the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\), based on institution need and in the interests of budgetary constraints. If the need for overtime no longer exists, the order in which employees are sent home will be the reverse order in which they overtime was hired \(i.e. bucketed employees, then voluntary overtime employees in order of last hired, first sent home\). The only exception to this is if the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) tells the employee, “You are hired for eight \(8\) hours \(or some other specified length of time.\)” Then the employee will work for that amount of time and they are paid according to Article 15 for time worked. Without the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) stating “A full shift” or “eight \(8\) hours” \(or some other specified time\), the overtime is subject to cancellation. This includes employees who volunteer to come in from home on voluntary overtime.
4. Employees who are required to provide certification for an attending physician to support the employee’s claim for sick leave under Article 33, Section 6, will not be eligible to volunteer for overtime during the time frame they are required to provide such certification.
5. Escorted inmate transports and hospital watches are exempt from voluntary overtime credits. Overtime will not generally be used to fill actual hospital watches. Staff shall be reassigned to the Hospital watch by the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) and the vacant position created from this reassignment shall be filled using the above agreed upon language. a. Ongoing hospital watches shall be considered voluntary assignments unless an emergency exists \(i.e. unscheduled medical need\). b. In the event that no volunteers want to accept an assignment for hospital watch, the OIC will assign an employee to work.
6. It is the responsibility of the employee who signs up for voluntary overtime to check with the OIC \(Lieutenant/Working Out of Class Lieutenant\) before they leave their shift to ask questions and to review the Mandatory Lists and On Shift Voluntary Overtime lists as needed.
7. If an employee reports an error in the assignment of voluntary overtime within forty-eight \(48\) hours, the Institution will review the matter and verify if an error has occurred. The Institution will then work with the employee to find another overtime opportunity within twenty-one \(21\) calendar days from the date of the verification of the error. The Institution will not correct any errors if the employee has not reported any verifiable error within forty-eight \(48\) hours and shall not be eligible for any overtime pay.
