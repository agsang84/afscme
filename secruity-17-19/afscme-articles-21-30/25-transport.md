# 25 - Transport

## Section 1

### a. **Duty Station:**

The Transport Unit maintains offices throughout the State of Oregon. The employee’s assigned office will be determined at the time of hire.

### b. **Overnight Travel:**

For the purpose of escorting inmates to and from the state of Oregon the agency will first seek volunteers using the out-of-state list. If no employee volunteers the employee at the top of the out-of-state list will be assigned the trip. Assigned staff may be flexed to accommodate flight schedules.

When assigned duties requiring overnight travel, there will be no out of pocket expenses incurred by employees. Covered expenses will be in accordance with the Department of Administrative Services travel policy and distributed by cash advance. Unforeseen covered expenses will be processed for reimbursement at the completion of the duty assignment.

If return travel plans are delayed due to circumstances beyond the control of the agency, the employee will be considered on-call. There will be an eight \(8\) hour break between the end of one \(1\) days and the beginning of the next workday except in emergencies, or unforeseen circumstances. This will be in accordance with the restrictions of Article 19 of this collective bargaining agreement. The employee has the option of receiving compensatory time equal to their regularly scheduled shift in lieu of the on-call pay.

### c. **Schedule Bidding:**

Due to variable start times and operational needs of the separate offices, each office retains the right to operate with or without a bid system. Employees assigned to Transportation can bid their regular start time and days off in order of seniority. Seniority, for the purpose of bidding will be calculated by time in classification according to Article 25, Section 8 \(Seniority\) of the Agreement except for Transport Unit employees hired before October 1, 2015 shall maintain their current seniority time. The Agency will post start time and day off schedules thirty \(30\) calendar days before the rotation date. Employees will have ten \(10\) working days following the posting of the work schedules to submit their bids. Selections will be submitted in priority order. Employees who do not submit a bid will be assigned by the agency.

Schedule bidding and rotations will occur every six \(6\) months effective on the first Sunday in July and January.

## Section 2.

### a. Flexible Work Schedule:

Staff may work a flexible work schedule. A flexible work schedule is a work schedule which may vary the start and stop times up to two \(2\) hours on a daily basis, and four \(4\) hours for night armed post qualification, but does not exceed the number of total normal duty hours previously scheduled for that day.

Employees assigned long distance transports will be permitted to eat their meal while on duty; time will count as time worked. There will be an eight \(8\)-hour break between the end of one \(1\) day and the beginning of the next work day except in emergencies, or unforeseen circumstances while on out-of-state trips, or when requested by the employee and where safety and security is not compromised.

### b. Overtime Meals:

Employees that work four \(4\) hours of overtime beyond their regularly scheduled shift will receive reimbursement for a meal at the per diem rate set by the Department of Administrative Services.

### c.

1. For schedule changes initiated by management which require an employee to arrive earlier than their regularly scheduled start time, the employee will be eligible for Early Start Time Premium Pay \(ETPP\). If an employee works part of the shift and uses paid leave to account for the balance of the shift, the employee will be eligible for Early Start Time Premium Pay \(ETPP\) if the employee is called in early the next day to work.
2. Early Start Time Premium Pay shall be at time and one half \(1/2\) of the employee’s straight time pay rate.
3. Employees receiving Early Start Time Premium Pay \(ETPP\) shall not be eligible for Call Back Pay \(Article 17\), ISD Differential \(Article 16:3\) or Turnaround Pay \(Article 15:3\).

### All Offices:

Except for the Salem Transportation Office, if, during the term of the Agreement, there are vacancies in the bargaining unit, the Agency may choose to schedule those positions as five \(5\) day eight \(8\) hour positions.

## Section 3

The purpose of this Section is to provide assistance to institutions with hospital watches, as the Transportation Unit’s workload permits. It is not the intent of this Agreement to provide the institutions with additional post relief. The Transportation Manager and/or Transport Office Lieutenant will coordinate the staff assignment with either the Institution Security Manager or the Shift Officer or the Shift Officer-in-Charge to facilitate the working assignments.

When workload permits, Transportation Security staff will be assigned the duties and responsibilities of inmate hospital watch on second shift. This assignment will be based on areas of responsibility assigned to each of the regional Transportation offices within the State of Oregon.

Assignment to a hospital watch will be accomplished by using the following protocol:

### A. General Operational Process

1. This ISDS Coordinator will develop and maintain a list for the purpose of selecting and assigning staff to cover hospital watches.
2. The area of responsibility for the Salem office will be Salem and Portland Metro area hospitals. The area of responsibility for the Umatilla Office will be Hermiston, Umatilla, Pendleton and Southeast Washington. The area of responsibility for the Ontario Transport Office will be Ontario and Southwest Idaho.

### B. Salem Office Operation Process

1. Monday-Friday \(dayshifts\): Transport will fill any straight time hospital watch positions that are still open and in need of staffing.
2. AFSCME staff on hospital watch will provide updates to the institution OIC on the disposition of the inmate and potential release time. The institution OIC will be responsible for any coordination necessary between these facilities that may result from these updates.
3. If there is need for a specialized vehicle, Transport will be notified and the Transport OIC will coordinate with the Institution OIC.
4. If overtime becomes necessary, it will be allocated to staff from where the inmate was last housed after all straight time hospital watch positions at both facilities have been utilized.
5. If mandated overtime is needed, the mandated overtime will be the responsibility of the facility from where the inmate was last housed.

## Section 4 - Voluntary Overtime \(all offices\)

1. The Agency will continue its voluntary overtime list for each office for Monday or Friday overtime. The list shall be monitored and maintained by the Transport Unit Lieutenant.
2. It is the responsibility of the staff member to request to be placed on the overtime list. Staff members can remove or add their name to the list at their discretion. If a staff member does not ask to have his name placed on the overtime list, the Agency will not contact him except in case of an emergency.
3. If an employee declines or the employee works an overtime opportunity, their name will be placed at the bottom of the list.
4. If the staff member has scheduled time off, it is the employee’s responsibility to remove his/her name from the list if they do not want to be contacted.
5. If there is a medical trip opportunity on Monday or Friday, the Transport Unit shall: 1. contact Transport Unit employees on the list who have volunteered to work voluntary overtime on Monday or Friday; 2. If there are no volunteers from the Transport Unit, the Transport Unit will contact the Institution where the medical trip is originating to arrange staffing to cover the medical trip assignment.

## Section 5 - Northwest Shuttle Assignment Process

1. A list of qualified and interested employees will be maintained by the Transport Lieutenant.
2. Employees will be assigned from the NW Shuttle list in order and once assigned will rotate to the bottom of the list.
