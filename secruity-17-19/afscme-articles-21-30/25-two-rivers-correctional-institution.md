# 25 - Two Rivers Correctional Institution

## Bidding Process

Each security staff member who has completed trial service may bid shifts, and days off in order of seniority. Shift/Days off bidding will allow employees to designate their preference. Seniority is defined in Section 8 of this Article. Employees whose trial service will be completed prior to the effective date of the shift and days off change shall be allowed to participate in the bidding process. Employees who fail to successfully bid or who do not apply to bid, will be assigned at the discretion of the institution’s management.

## DSU Bidding Process:

1. Prior to the normally scheduled bid process, TRCI management will solicit letters of interest from all security staff that have an interest in working in DSU. All letters of interest must be received prior to the announced closing date. The Letters will be reviewed and those security staff will be offered a position in DSU to include Position, Shift and Days off.
2. If the security staff member accepts the assignment, he/she may voluntarily choose to forego the normally scheduled bid process. If the employee who has been assigned as DSU assignment choses to bid out of DSU, and another employee is selected for the DSU assignment, there shall not be an Institution wide rebid. However, the vacant assignment shall be filled under the conditions outlined for the midshift rotation bid process.
3. If the security staff member declines the assignment offered, he/she will then be allowed to proceed with the normal bid process utilizing their seniority.
4. Those Security staff who request to be assigned to DSU will be required to bid out of DSU after working two \(2\) years consecutively for one \(1\) bid rotation before requesting to work in DSU again.
5. If the security staff member is removed from segregation, management will attempt to maintain the employee on the same shift and days off until the next normal scheduled bid.

In DSU, trial service staff will not be available for cell extraction teams. When trial service staff are assigned to DSU, every effort will be made to partner them to a permanent DSU staff.

At least fourteen \(14\) days prior to shift and vacation bids, management and the union will meet to review the process, give comment and help alleviate any foreseeable problems to the bid through dialogue that arises. At this meeting the Institution will provide bid sheets, post lists, bid times, call in number and seniority list. If there are any changes to these documents from the last bid the Institution will highlight those changes. The Institution will continue to authorize the local Union President or designee to attend and monitor the bid. The bid processes shall be done through a mutual consultation of management and the union with the knowledge that management maintains all of its rights of Article 10 pertaining to this process.

If an employee is on shift during his/her bid time, management will make arrangements to have that employee relieved so they may participate in the bid process and hold the bid until that employee has placed a bid.

Bids will address only shifts and days off. Bidding will occur every six \(6\) months, becoming effective on the first Sunday of April and October.

a. For shifts and days off assignments that are identified to a specific post an employee cannot use seniority to secure that assignment for more than two \(2\) consecutive bids.

b. Institution management will make the specific daily work schedules and may only remove or deny an employee from a work schedule for valid cause.

c. Trial Service employees will not be assigned to a single medical trip/hospital watch or armed hospital watch.

d. For purpose of filling a vacant assignment the institution will announce the opening to all staff. Staff must submit a memo of interest to be considered for that assignment. An announcement is only required during the first three \(3\) months after a regular bid. The employee with the most seniority in class shall be selected for the position.

## Mandatory Overtime

a. The mandatory overtime list is kept electronically and maintained by the officer in charge \(O.I.C.\) and will be accessible for viewing by all employees.

b. The mandatory overtime list will be updated at the end of each shift by the O.I.C. for all individuals who have either worked any time as mandatory overtime, or a qualifying voluntary overtime of at least four \(4\) hours. Each OIC will place his/her initials next to the staff name as they are moved from the bucket list.

c. An individual must work a minimum of twenty \(20\) minutes mandatory overtime to be moved on the mandatory overtime list.

d. Employees on the mandatory overtime list will be moved in the following priority:

1. An employee who was placed “In the Bucket”, or next on the list for mandatory overtime, but did not work will go at the top of the mandatory overtime list, for that shift, and that day. 
2. An employee who has worked qualifying voluntary overtime of at least four \(4\) hours will be placed directly below the individual “In the Bucket”, in the order that they were hired.
3. An employee who was “bucketed”, or forced into mandatory overtime will be placed directly below the voluntary overtime\(s\) hired in the order they were forced into overtime.

e. All employees required to work mandatory overtime will be released before any employees volunteering for overtime are released.

2. It is the employee’s day prior to scheduled leave
3. It is the employee’s day prior to a scheduled time-trade day off.

h. If an employee locates a volunteer that agrees to replace them on mandatory overtime, then both employees will be moved on the mandatory overtime list. In no event shall the agency attempt to utilize an employee more than once during the shift for mandatory overtime, nor place an employee “in the bucket” more than once during the shift.

i. An employee who works first shift mandatory overtime will be credited for the date on the mandatory overtime list that the overtime ended on.

j. If an employee completes a minimum of four hours voluntary overtime prior to the beginning of the employee’s assigned shift, he/she will be moved to the bottom of the mandatory overtime list.
