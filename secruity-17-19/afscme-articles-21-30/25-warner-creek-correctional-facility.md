# 25 - Warner Creek Correctional Facility

## Section 1 - Bidding Process:

Employees who have completed initial trial service may bid shifts and days off in order of seniority as defined in Section 8 of this Article. Employees who fail to successfully bid, or who do not bid, will be assigned at the discretion of the Institution’s Security Management. Bids will address only shift and days off. Bidding will occur every six \(6\) months, becoming effective on the first Sunday of April and October. The Security Manager shall post work schedules thirty \(30\) calendar days before the rotation date. The mechanics of the bidding procedure shall be determined by the labor/management team. All bids must be in writing, signed by the biding employee, and numbered by preference, if placing more than one \(1\) bid. Employees may submit up to three \(3\) bids. The new schedule will be posted no less than seven \(7\) calendar days prior to the effective date.

Effective April 2017 bid cycle, all Sergeant, Corporals and Officer schedules will bid every six \(6\) months.

## Section 2 - Seniority

Shift and days off bidding will be in conformance with Section 8 of the Article. The following clarifications are as follows:

**New Hires** – Newly hired employees with the same date of hire will have their seniority determined by lottery drawing with a Union representative present.

**Transfers** – When a staff member transfers into WCCF with the same date of hire as an existing staff member, the existing staff member shall be granted the higher seniority within the classification.

**Promotional Hires** – When newly promoted employees have the same promotional hire date, their seniority shall be determined by total bargaining unit seniority. If the affected employees have the same promotional hire date and the same total bargaining unit seniority, the employee who will have higher seniority will be established by lottery drawing \(i.e., draw a number from a hat with a local union officer present\).

Institution’s Security Management will make the specific daily work schedule and may only remove or deny an employee from their bid or post for valid cause.

Security staff assigned to a Flex position may be assigned to various shifts and days off in order to provide relief to other staff \(i.e., general, compensatory time, training, sick leave\). When not assigned to relieve another staff member, the staff assigned to a Flex position will be assigned to a shift and days off as determined by the Security Manger.

For the purpose of filling a permanently vacant assignment, the institution will announce the opening to all Security staff. Staff must submit a memo of interest to the Institution Security Manager to be considered for that assignment. If two \(2\) or more employees are deemed to possess equal knowledge, skills and abilities, the employee with the most seniority in class shall be selected for the position.

## Section 3 - Assignment of Overtime

### 1. Unscheduled Overtime

At the time when mandatory overtime is required on a shift, a review of all shift absences will be conducted, without consideration of which absence was created first, to determine the proper assignment of overtime, starting with the Lieutenant position and working down the chain of command. No represented staff member will cover an absence created by a management service member, except out of class lieutenants.

The person assigned as the “Bucket person” shall have the option of accepting the overtime prior to unscheduled overtime being announced to all staff on duty, if the overtime immediately follows their current shift. Refusing the overtime does not satisfy the bucket obligation. However, accepting the overtime and working the overtime or finding a staff member to share part of the shift does satisfy their bucket obligation. The intent is to allow the Bucket person the first \(1st\) opportunity at overtime because he/she is interested in working the overtime.

Otherwise, volunteers will be sought by contact with all staff on shift by announcement over the radio followed by contacting volunteers on the volunteer list. Transport and Work Crew Officers will need to notify the OIC at the beginning of their shift or before they depart WFFC for their assigned duties if they are interested in any possible overtime.

The Officer in Charge \(OIC\) asks on-duty staff for volunteers to cover the whole shift. If two or more security staff are interested in the voluntary overtime it will be decided by a lottery draw which will be conducted at least 10 minutes after the announcement of overtime and in the presence of at least two \(2\) staff and one \(1\) security management staff.

If no one volunteers for the overtime, and time permitting, the OIC calls at home those staff members who previously indicated their wish to be contacted for voluntary maintained by the OIC.

If still not covered, the OIC informs the staff member on the bucket list of the overtime requirement.

The OIC will allow the staff member a brief opportunity to call peers to cover all or part of the shift if requested by the staff member. In this instance, if the bucketed person is successful in finding a replacement for all or part of the shift, their bucket obligation shall be satisfied.

### 2. Scheduled Overtime

Opportunities will be indicated on the weekly shift overtime schedule board when deemed necessary \(Posted in Security Admin\). The ISDS Coordinator or OIC will announce over the radio that “scheduled overtime has been posted”. The ISDS Coordinator or Institution Security Management shall post it on rotating shifts each week so different shifts have equal opportunity. The announcement and posting shall happen at least thirty \(30\) minutes after the beginning of the shift. Any posting of overtime, including additional overtime added after the initial posting, must allow for the two \(2\)-hour sign up period and subsequent lottery draw for the designated shift or otherwise not be added or posted until the next day on the appropriate shift.

Within the first two \(2\) hours of the announcement, all security staff interested in overtime may sign up for as many of the posted shifts as they desire and work a one \(1\) hour minimum for each shift they signed up for, or the overtime will be reposted/announced over the radio if the staff cancels before the twenty-four \(24\) hour cancelation notice. They must be qualified to work the desired shift \(e.g. does not result in more than a sixteen \(16\)-hour shift, does not conflict with previous trades\). If two \(2\) \(or more\) persons are interested in the same posted shift, a lottery draw will determine the winner. If only one \(1\) person signs up for a posted shift during the first two \(2\) hours, that person is awarded that overtime. Any posted overtime remaining unfilled after two \(2\) hours may be filled on a first come, first served basis until filled.

It is the responsibility of the potential overtime recipient to be present and sign up in person during the sign up period, with the exception of “on duty staff” that may be away from the institution \(e.g. on the transport, hospital watch, work crew\). If “on duty staff”, who are away from the institution express a desire for overtime to the OIC prior to their departure, the OIC or his designee will make a legitimate effort to contact that employee. The Management will not be burdened with contacting off duty staff about scheduled overtime. The lottery draws will be conducted after the two \(2\)-hour sign up period in the presence of the one \(1\) manager and two \(2\) represented staff. The process will not interfere with the orderly operation of the shift as the intent is to allow all on duty staff and/or staff present at the institution a fair opportunity to sign up and receive overtime.

Availability of overtime opportunities may be included on the e-mail shift briefing.

If scheduled overtime is not filled in advance, it will be handled as unscheduled overtime.

Cancellation: Scheduled overtime may be cancelled by the employer or employee with a minimum of twenty-four \(24\)-hour notice to the employer or employee. Acceptable notice will include message phone numbers, employee answering machines or contact with the OIC.

### Bucket List:

The Bucket List is intended to be a fair way to allocate mandatory overtime among Correctional Security Staff in the event that no staff member volunteers as described above for overtime.

The OIC shall be responsible for maintaining the Bucket List daily for their assigned shift.

The Bucket List for each shift will be created every six month at shift change. The initial order of the list will be by shift position number from lowest to highest. If a new person is added to the shift after the list has been created, that person will be added to the bottom of the current list. Staff on flex assignment will be given the option of whether or not to have their name placed on the bucket list; however, their choice will be in effect for the entire bid cycle.

The Bucket List shall reflect on a daily basis, for each shift, who shall be assigned mandatory overtime if the OIC is unable to find volunteers. The top name on the Bucket List for each shift will be the staff member in the bucket for the day on their shift. However, if the person whose name is at the top of the Bucket List is not scheduled to work the next day \(i.e. regular day off, approved leave, time trade, etc.\) or if placement in the bucket and subsequent assignment of overtime would cause a person to three successive shifts or over 16 hours, that person’s name will be skipped and the next name on the list will be considered in the same manner. If a person’s name is skipped, their name will be reconsidered each day until they are actually assigned to the bucket for a shift. Only the person who is named as being in the bucket for the shift will have their name moved automatically to the bottom of the list. If others are required to work overtime, they will also have their names automatically moved to the bottom of the Bucket List.

The OIC will, by the same method, determine who else will be required to work if more staff are needed to fill all required posts.

If additional bucket situations arise during the same shift, and the first bucket person satisfied their bucket obligation, the next person on the list will be responsible to cover the mandatory overtime as outlined above.

In the event that two \(2\) or more staff are on mandatory overtime and management locates a staff to volunteer to work part or all of one \(1\) of the overtime shifts, the last person bucketed will be the first \(1st\) person released. All bucketed staff will have the option to locate a staff member to work part or all of their overtime in accordance with “Overtime Conditions and Restrictions” paragraph 2.

Staff members shall not be placed on the Bucket List on the last day of their work week \(i.e. their Friday\) except in an emergency, but may still volunteer.

Staff members shall not be placed on the Bucket List if they have already signed up for the overtime or are scheduled for overtime for a shift which would cause that staff member to work more than 16 hours in a 24-hour period.

Staff who are working a shift as a result of a time trade do not take the regular staff member’s place on the Bucket List.

Any Staff who works any amount of voluntary overtime will have their name automatically placed at the bottom of the bucket list unless they notify the OIC not to move their name to the bottom. The staff assigned as first in the bucket and any additional staff that are mandatorily bucketed will have their names moved to the bottom of the bucket list with the option to remain at the top. Such request must be made on the same day that the overtime is worked.

Institution Security Management shall provide staff with at least one \(1\) hour notice prior to being bucketed, except for last minute call-ins or declared emergency situations.

### Overtime Conditions and Restrictions:

Staff working overtime, either voluntary or mandatory, are expected to cover the entire shift of overtime.

Staff who are filling overtime may make their own arrangements with their peers to cover part of the shift. The OIC will provide the staff member a brief opportunity to contact peers for partial coverage if they request and time is reasonably available.

Staff will not be mandated to work overtime as a result of the mandatory overtime list while on approved vacation or while attending Agency-assigned training, unless an emergency recall has been initiated.

All medical trips will be scheduled in advance when possible, and the bucket list shall only be used for emergency medical trips. Voluntary overtime for medical trips will be posted in a timely manner to ensure staff are aware of the availability of this overtime.

### Voluntary List:

The voluntary overtime list shall be maintained by the OIC and it will also be viewable on the P: drive.

Staff that volunteer or refuse voluntary overtime shall be moved to the bottom of the voluntary overtime list.
