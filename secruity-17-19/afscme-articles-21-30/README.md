## ARTICLE 21 - LEADWORK DIFFERENTIAL

### Section 1

Leadwork differential shall be defined as a differential for employees who have been formally assigned by their supervisor, in writing, "leadwork" duties over three \(3\) or more employees in their classification or salary range for ten \(10\) consecutive calendar days or longer. Leadwork is where, on a recurring daily basis, while performing essentially the same duties as the workers led, the employee has been directed to perform substantially all of the following functions: to orient new employees, if appropriate; assign and reassign tasks to accomplish prescribed work efficiently; give direction to workers concerning work procedures; transmit established standards of performance to workers; review work of employees for conformance to standards; and provide informal assessment of workers' performance to the supervisor.

### Section 2

The differential shall be five percent \(5%\) beginning from the first day the duties were formally assigned in writing for the full period of the assignment.

### Section 3

Leadwork differential shall not be computed at the rate of time and one-half \(1-1/2\) for the time worked in an overtime or holiday work situation, or to effect a "pyramiding" of work out-of- classification payment.

### Section 4

Leadwork differential shall not apply for voluntary training and development purposes which are mutually agreed to in writing between the supervisor and the employee.

### Section 5

The employee who believes they are performing the duties of a leadworker as defined in Section 1, may request a review of the duties as follows:

a. The employee shall notify their supervisor and appropriate Personnel Officer, in writing for a review.

b. The supervisor, on behalf of the Agency, will respond to the employee in writing, within fifteen \(15\) calendar days from the date of notification.

c. If it is the Agency's determination that the leadwork duties were assigned, the leadwork differential will be effective the date the employee notified the supervisor.

d. If the Agency determines that the duties are not leadworker or wishes to remove the duties, the employee will be notified as noted in "b" of this Article.

## ARTICLE 22 - TRAVEL AND MOVING EXPENSE

### Section 1

Travel, mileage and moving expenses shall be reimbursed as per the Department of Administrative Services Accounting Manual rate adjustments.

### Section 2

## ARTICLE 23 - EMERGENCIES

### Section 1

During periods of bona fide emergency, provisions of this agreement regarding work assignments and scheduling, job posting, and overtime scheduling may be temporarily suspended by the Agency as required for the duration of the emergency. Appropriate notification of the emergency status will be made to the Union’s Council Representative and local Union President or designee.

### Section 2

Emergency is defined as an unforeseen circumstance which may threaten the safety and security of the public, inmates, employees and/or property.

### Section 3

This Article shall not be used by management to justify suspension of the above described contract rights to meet the daily operational needs in filling unexpected shift vacancies due to absences of scheduled staff which occur from time to time.

## ARTICLE 24 - USE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS

### Section 1 - Policy

The Department of Corrections and AFSCME agree the purpose of this Agreement on alcohol and drug testing is to help ensure the work place is free from the effects of drug and alcohol abuse, and to do so in a way as to protect each employee’s constitutional and statutory rights. The Department of Corrections is committed to assisting regular status employees to overcome drug and alcohol problems through appropriate treatment programs and, if necessary, disciplinary action. The presence or treatment of a substance use problem will not excuse an employee from meeting performance, safety or attendance standards or following other DOC instructions. Trial service employees are not subject to the provisions of this Section.

### Section 2 - Prohibited Conduct

The following conduct is prohibited:

a. The buying, selling, or providing, or possession for the purpose of buying, selling, or providing controlled substances including marijuana while on Agency property or in Agency vehicles or equipment, or during work hours, including paid rest and meal periods.

b. Being under the influence of alcoholic intoxicants, or consuming alcoholic intoxicants while in Agency vehicles or equipment at any time, or on Agency property, including rest and meal periods.

c. Being at work with a blood alcohol content that reaches or exceeds .02% by volume/weight of alcohol in the blood.

d. Possession of any controlled substance including marijuana while on Agency property or in Agency vehicles or equipment at any time, including rest and meal periods. However, this excludes substances that have been legally prescribed for an employee’s own use.

e. Being at work under the influence of any controlled substance, including marijuana, or having such substances present in the body while on Agency property or in Agency vehicles or equipment at any time, including rest and meal periods. An employee has controlled substance present in the body when the employee tests positive in blood or urine tests administered by the Agency for drug and alcohol testing. An employee shall be deemed to test positive for cannabinoids \(marijuana or hashish\) if his or her urine test indicates fifty \(50\) or more nanograms’ THC metabolites/ml. However, this excludes substances that have been prescribed for an employee’s own use.

f. Abusing any substance which is lawfully prescribed by regularly taking it in excessive quantities or by unlawfully obtaining it for purposes of abuse.

g. For purposes of this Agreement, the term controlled substance shall be defined in accordance with ORS 475.005\(6\).

### Section 3 - Under the Influence

The term under the influence of controlled substances including marijuana or alcoholic intoxicants covers not only all the well-known and easily recognized conditions and degrees of impairment and intoxication, but any perceptible abnormal mental or physical condition which is the result of indulging to any degree in controlled substances, marijuana or alcoholic intoxicants which perceptibly tend to deprive the use of that clearness of intellect and control the employee would otherwise possess.

### Section 4 - Discipline and Other Action

Prohibited conduct described in Sections 2a and 2d above shall result in termination. Prohibited conduct described in Sections 2b, 2c, 2e and 2f shall result in actions specified in Section 6 below.

### Section 5 - Reasonable Suspicion Testing

a. Where the Agency has a reasonable suspicion that en employee is under the influence of any alcoholic intoxicants or controlled substances, including marijuana, or has a controlled substance, including marijuana, present in the body, the Agency may require that the employee immediately consent and submit to field and impairment tests and sampling \(blood, urine or Breathalyzer test\) at an approved laboratory. The Agency shall pay for the costs of the tests. A refusal to consent and submit to any of these tests shall be deemed the same as a positive test result.

b. When the employee is notified he or she is required to consent and submit to such test, or to searches as described in Section 8 of this Article, he or she may request the presence of a Union representative to witness the tests or searches. The tests or searches may not be unduly delayed in order to wait for a representative. The absence of a representative shall not be grounds for the employee to refuse to consent and submit to such tests or searches, however the Agency shall make every reasonable effort to provide a Union representative. The presence of a representative shall not disrupt or interfere with the tests or searches.

c. Before a supervisor, acting on behalf of the Agency under this policy, may require an employee to consent and submit to any test\(s\) specified in this section, the supervisor must first obtain concurrence from the supervisor’s department head or his designee that the information available to the Agency about the subject employee is sufficient to determine reasonable suspicion that prohibited conduct will be established as a result of such test\(s\).

d. The employee shall give consent to a blood, urine or Breathalyzer test by signing a consent form. The form shall contain the following information:

1. Employees consent to release test results to the Agency; 
2. The procedure for confirming an initial positive test result for a controlled substance, including marijuana; 
3. The consequences of a confirmed positive test result for a controlled substance, including marijuana; 
4. The consequences of a positive test for alcohol, including one at or above .02% by volume/weight of alcohol in the blood; 
5. A listing provided by the employee of legally prescribed and over-the-counter medications which may be in the employee’s body. At the employee’s option, this information may be submitted in a sealed envelope to be opened only by the Medical Review Officer if the test result is positive; 
6. The right to explain a confirmed positive test result for a controlled substance, including marijuana, or a positive test for alcohol to the Medical Review Officer; 
7. The right to have a Union representative present during the preliminary interview and any follow-up investigation; 
8. The consequences of refusing to consent to the blood, urine, or Breathalyzer test.

e. The drug testing process shall be one that is scientifically proven to be at least as accurate and valid as urinalysis using an immunoassay screening test, with all positive screening results being confirmed utilizing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry before a sample is considered positive. The alcohol testing process shall be one that is scientifically proven to be at least as accurate and valid as \(1\) urinalysis using an enzymatic assay screening test, with the positive screening results being confirmed using gas chromatography before a sample is considered positive, or \(2\) breath sample testing using breath analyzing instruments which meet NIDA/SAMSHA testing standards.

f. If a blood or urine test is confirmed as positive, the Agency will instruct the laboratory to retain the blood or urine sample for a period of not less than thirty \(30\) calendar days from the date the test results are communicated to the employee for the purpose of allowing the employee to conduct an independent test of the sample at his or her own expense at a laboratory approved by the State of Oregon.

g. The procedure followed under this Agreement to obtain, handle and store blood and urine samples and to conduct laboratory tests shall be documented to establish procedural integrity and chain of evidence. Such procedures shall be administered with due regard for the employee’s privacy and the need to maintain confidentiality of test results to an extent which is not inconsistent with the needs of this policy. The employee shall be notified of the results of all tests conducted pursuant to this policy. Additionally, all facts and circumstances upon which the reasonable suspicion testing is based, shall be documented and given to the employee when he or she is notified of the test results.

### Section 6 - Consequences of Test Results

a. Test results which do not positively establish the employee has engaged in prohibited conduct as described in Sections 2b, 2c, 2e or 2f of this Article shall result in no further action against the employee related to an alleged violation of those sections. The employee shall be informed of such test results in writing. Persons who do not test positive shall not have any record of the test placed in his or her official personnel file. Working files may contain records of the observations which led to the reasonable suspicion testing but not records of the test itself. If the employee subsequently demonstrates similar behaviors, these records may be relied upon by the employer in disciplinary proceedings.

b. If an employee who tests positive and has not previously committed prohibited conduct specified in Sections 2b, 2c, 2e or 2f of this Article, the employee shall immediately submit to a medical evaluation by a doctor selected and paid for by the Agency. The evaluation will determine the extent of the employee’s use of, and dependence on, the applicable substance\(s\) and, if necessary, recommend an appropriate program of treatment, including but not limited to rehabilitation and counseling to prevent future use. If a program of treatment is recommended by the doctor, the employee shall enroll in it immediately. Failure by the employee to enroll in the recommended program or to complete it successfully shall result in his or her termination from employment. The cost of such treatment shall be at the employee’s expense except as it may be covered by insurance. The employee may take paid leave or leave without pay for the period of treatment.

c. The first instance of an alcohol test result of .02% to .039% shall not be considered a positive test result for alcohol for the purpose of requiring a medical evaluation by a doctor. An employee may use vacation and/or sick leave benefits for this time period. It will, however, require that the employee be removed from duty until their next scheduled shift. An alcohol test result of a .04% or greater will subject the employee to all provisions of this Agreement.

d. If an employee who tests positive and has previously committed prohibited conduct specified in Sections 2b, 2c, 2e or 2f, and subsequently is found to have committed such prohibited conduct a second time within three \(3\) years, he or she shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination. The level of discipline imposed for subsequent instances of such prohibited conduct beyond three \(3\) years may be termination but shall be determined on a case-by-case basis.

### Section 7 - Voluntary Rehabilitation

a. The primary objectives of the Agency’s drug and alcohol policy are to maintain employee performance and good health and a safe work environment. If, prior to a requirement by the Agency that the employee submit to any of the tests specified in Section 5 of this Article, the employee notifies a supervisor he or she has drug or alcohol problems that require treatment, then in that event the employee shall immediately submit to a medical evaluation by a doctor selected and paid for by the Agency and shall enroll in a treatment program recommended by the doctor. An employee may seek such evaluation and treatment from the employee’s own doctor, at the employee’s expense. The employee shall notify the employer of the name of the doctor. An employee who enters rehabilitation and successfully completes rehabilitation under the terms of this paragraph shall not be subject to discipline. The cost of such treatment shall be at the employee’s expense except as it may be covered by insurance. The employee may take paid leave or leave without pay for the period of treatment.

b. If an employee has previously enrolled in a voluntary rehabilitative treatment described in subsection a and subsequently again volunteers for such treatment in advance of being required to submit to any of these tests specified in Section 5 of this Article, then the employee shall immediately submit to a medical evaluation by a doctor selected and paid for by the Agency and shall successfully complete the treatment program recommended by the doctor. An employee may seek such evaluation and treatment from the employee’s own doctor, at the employee’s expense. The employee shall notify the employer of the name of the doctor. If the employee fails to complete the treatment program successfully, he or she shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination. The cost of such treatment shall be at the employee’s expense except as it may be covered by insurance. The employee may take paid leave or leave without pay for the period of treatment.

### Section 8 - Searches

The Agency reserves the right to conduct searches for any reason of Agency equipment or facilities generally, and may search anything or area in which the employee has an expectation of privacy \(i.e., desk, locker, outer garment clothing or personal property\) to the extent permitted by law. Refusal by the employee to submit to a lawful search shall result in termination.

Strip searches and frisk searches will be undertaken in the event of a criminal investigation and only for probable cause as determined by the investigating law enforcement agency.

### Section 9 - Consequences of Search Results

a. Reasonable suspicion searches which do not reveal the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, including marijuana \(but excluding any substance lawfully prescribed for the employee’s use which has not been obtained for the purpose of abuse\), shall result in no further action against the employee related to an alleged violation of Section 2d. The employee shall be informed of such search results in writing.

b. Searches which reveal the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, including marijuana \(but excluding any substance prescribed for the employee’s use which has not been obtained for the purpose of abuse\), shall result in those consequences specified in Section 4 as though a positive blood or confirmed urine test had been administered.

### Section 10 - Training

The Agency recognizes that, in order to administer the standards and procedures set forth in this Agreement fairly and to minimize the possibility of unwarranted testing and searches, supervisory personnel shall receive training in how to recognize and deal effectively with substance abuse in the work place. Accordingly, the Agency will provide such training to supervisors and designated Union representatives before the requirements of this Agreement are implemented and enforced. Annual in-service training and an updating program will be developed and administered to supervisory personnel within the Agency and designated Union Officers and Stewards.

### Section 11 - Emergencies

In the event of emergency the Agency wishes to call back an off duty employee to perform additional duties and the employee has consumed intoxicants, the employee will notify his or her supervisor that he or she has consumed intoxicants and is impaired and therefore is unable to report for duty and suffer no discipline or other consequences.

## ARTICLE 25 - WORKING CONDITIONS

### Section 1 - Work Week

a. **Workweek Defined:** The workweek for the Institutions shall begin at 12:01 a.m. Sunday and end at 12:00 Midnight the following Saturday.

Saturday and Sunday will be considered as consecutive days off within the workweek.

b. **Workweek Adjustments:** If a variance from this paragraph is required in order to accomplish the mission of the Institution, the Agency shall notify the Union of the reasons for the change prior to its effective date and the Union Local President and Council Representative shall be afforded an opportunity to comment and offer alternative suggestions. If the Union feels the change is unreasonable, the matter may be processed as a grievance.

### Section 2 - Working Hours

a. **Work Hours Defined:** The standard workday shall be a period of twenty-four \(24\) hours, containing eight \(8\) or ten \(10\) consecutive hours of work interrupted by rest and meal periods.

b. **Rest Periods:** Rest periods will normally consist of two \(2\), fifteen \(15\) minute breaks. Rest periods preferably will occur between the second \(2nd\) and third \(3rd\) hours and the fifth \(5th\) and sixth \(6th\) hours of the employee's shift. Management agrees to make every reasonable effort to allow rest breaks. However, the Parties recognize that not every break can be granted on every shift or that breaks will occur on regular and recurring intervals. It is expected that employees will notify their shift supervisor in a timely manner if a break is missed.

c. **Security & Recreation staff:** Where security and recreation staff have a past practice allowing informal breaks to occur, that practice shall continue on a reasonable basis consistent with Section 2b above.

d. **Split Shifts:** Computer generated work schedules will be reviewed and a good faith effort made to minimize the number of schedules which contain split shifts.

### Section 3 - Meal Periods at Institutions

a. **Scheduling:** A meal period shall be scheduled for each employee at approximately the mid-period of the workday, as work permits. This period shall begin upon the employee being relieved and shall end upon the employee's return to the work station.

b. **Overtime:** A reasonable meal period shall be allowed at the conclusion of a regular shift when a security employee works overtime shifts of at least four \(4\) hours beyond the employee's regular shift. The Agency shall furnish the meal, and the time shall count as time worked. If an employee is called back to work a full four \(4\)-hour overtime shift with less than two \(2\) hours notice, the employee's meal will be furnished by the Agency.

c. **Work Performed During Meal:** A meal period shall be allowed each employee as work permits. Employees who are not relieved from the employees' shift, and are required to remain in their work area while eating, shall have such time counted as time worked. In no instance shall an employee be required to use a meal period in excess of one \(1\) hour.

d. **Cost of Meals:** Meals are at the employee's expense. The Department shall provide adequate dry and refrigerated storage for employees' meals.

e. 1 - 2

1. If an employee purchases a meal at the Institution during their regular unpaid meal period, and during that unpaid meal break Institution management directs the employee to respond or return to work before his/her purchased meal is consumed, he/she shall report the matter to his/her OIC on shift within two \(2\) hours of the incident occurring in order to resolve it.
2. If there are unresolved issues surrounding a Security Unit employee being directed by Institution management to respond during his/her unpaid meal break where they have purchased an Institution meal, it will be addressed at the Institution’s local labor/management committee. Any resolution shall not create any new benefit or right for Security staff. Any local resolution will be on a case by case basis and shall be Institution specific.

### Section 4 - Clean-Up Time in Institution

Except in emergencies, employees in the unit shall be allowed a reasonable amount of clean-up time during duty hours, prior to meal breaks and completion of shift. Abuses of clean-up time may be subject to disciplinary action.

### Section 5 - Vacation Relief

The Agency will continue to use Correctional Officers to relieve other security staff on vacation without penalty.

### Section 6 - Security Briefings

Where security staff are required to attend security briefings prior to commencement of their shift, it shall be counted as time worked and paid in accordance with [**Article 15, Overtime**](../afscme-articles-11-20.md#article-15-overtime).

### Section 7 - Time Trades

a. Employees may agree to time trades with other employees who are qualified to perform the duties required in the course of the trade. Such agreement shall be in writing and signed by the affected employees and shall contain specific dates of the trade. Supervisors shall not withhold approval of time trades without valid cause.

b. Time trades are voluntary agreements between employees and shall not cause financial liability to the Agency. Employees are individually responsible to ensure the time trade occurs as approved. The employee who fails to complete the trade as approved shall be charged with leave without pay, unless other leave is approved by the employee’s supervisor.

c. If an employee reports for duty on a time trade and the Officer in Charge \(OIC\) determines staff are able to be relieved from work, the employee on time trade will be eligible to request vacation leave using the same Institution process for relieving staff as any other employee on duty. Use of vacation leave under this Subsection shall not count as hours worked for the purpose of overtime calculation.

d. Time trade requests may not be changed unless agreed to by the Parties through submission of a new request.

e. Employees shall submit their trade requests seven \(7\) days in advance of the trade date. If a trade is denied a brief explanation shall be provided on the form which will then be returned to the employee.

f. All time trades shall be completed within a ninety \(90\) day time period.

g. The notification deadline and/or the completion period may be extended or reduced at individual functional units by mutual agreement between the local Union and the functional unit Manager via the labor/management meeting process.

Assistant Superintendent of Security or designee, may reduce the minimum notification deadline or extend the completion period at their discretion and with the agreement of the affected employee.

### Section 8 - Seniority

a. For purposes of bidding under Article 25, Working Conditions, seniority is defined as time in classification in the AFSCME security bargaining unit, except that employees in the bargaining unit on July 1, 1994, shall retain the seniority date they have in their current position until such time as the employee leaves that position.

The intent is that an employee in the AFSCME security series on July 1, 1994, keeps the seniority date negotiated in the 1992-94 Agreement for as long as the employee remains in the classification and functional unit the employee was in on that date. Once the employee leaves that position by promoting to a higher classification in the security series, transferring to a position in the same classification in another AFSCME-represented functional unit, or leaves the bargaining unit security series for any reason and then returns, the employee's seniority date will be recomputed to meet the definition of "time in class in the security bargaining unit." Seniority not sanctioned by this Agreement will not be recognized.

If AOCE represented employees employed by the Agency elect AFSCME as their exclusive bargaining agent, the definition of seniority, for the purpose of shift bidding, shall be Agency Time in Classification for all bargaining unit employees. As a result, all of Section 8 \(a\) of this article shall become null and void. This provision will become effective on the next shift/days off bid cycle after the Employment Relations Board certifies the bargaining unit. The Agency shall recalculate employee job bidding seniority and provide the Union a copy of this report.

b. Seniority for bargaining unit employees who experience breaks in service shall be calculated as follows:

Bargaining unit members who leave the bargaining unit and then return, shall be credited with their previous AFSCME bargaining unit seniority in classification which is only the days earned while in that classification upon their return \(Subject to the provisions listed below\).

1. Employees who leave Agency service and return within one hundred eighty \(180\) days, shall be credited with their previous AFSCME in class seniority which is only the days earned while in that classification upon their return or within two \(2\) years if the separation was a result of lay off. 
2. Employees who leave Agency service, for a period longer than one hundred eighty \(180\) days for any reason other than lay off then return, shall lose all seniority for the purpose of bidding. 
3. Employees who transfer within classification between AFSCME represented bargaining units, shall maintain their classification seniority. 
4. Employees who promote or demote into represented classifications within the Agency and then return to a previously held classification shall have their previous AFSCME in classification seniority reinstated by crediting only the days earned while in that classification. 
5. Employees who promote into management classifications within the Agency and then return within one \(1\) year to a previously held classification shall have their previous AFSCME in classification seniority reinstated crediting only the days earned while in that classification. Employees who remain in a management classification more than one \(1\) year shall lose all previously earned AFSCME in classification time.

c. Institution Specific Bidding Seniority will be determined as follows, except where there is a conflict between Section C and a local Article 25 provision, this section shall prevail.

1. New Hires – Newly hired employees with the same date of hire will have their seniority determined by lottery drawing with a Union representative present. 
2. Transfers – When a staff member transfers within the AFSCME Security represented bargaining unit with the same AFSCME classification seniority date of hire as an existing staff member, the existing staff member shall be granted the higher seniority within the classification. On occasions when an employee returns to an institution they were previously employed, they shall be returned to seniority placement originally obtained through lottery bid for employees hired or promoted on the same date providing the AFSCME in classification time remains the same. 
3. Promotional Hires – When newly promoted staff have the same promotional hire date their seniority will be first determined by total bargaining unit seniority. If bargaining unit seniority is equal, total Agency time in the security series will be utilized to determine the higher seniority. If seniority would still be the same, seniority will be determined by lottery drawing with a union representative present.

d. Administration of Lists

1. Six weeks before a Post or Shift and Days off bid at an institution, the ISDS coordinator will post the current job bidding seniority list.  
2. If an employee’s seniority date has been changed or reinstated after promotion or demotion to a previously held classification and the employee disputes their seniority date, they shall submit the issue in writing to the local Institution Human Resources Manager within ten \(10\) calendar days of the date they become aware of the matter. The Human Resources Manager will forward a copy to the Local President and Local Oregon AFSCME Council Representative.

Functional Units where the question or issue regarding seniority originates, the Local President or Vice President will serve as a labor representative and voting member of the Seniority Panel to be formed. Additionally, Management will select their one \(1\) representative from the following positions: Superintendent, Assistant Superintended of Security \(or Security Manager\) or Operations Capitan who will serve as a Management representative and voting member on the Seniority Panel to be formed.

Those two \(2\) individuals, together with that Functional Unit’s Oregon AFSCME Council 75 staff Representative and an individual from Department of Corrections Labor Relations or that Functional Unit’s Human Resources Manager, will observe the selection of the remaining members of the panel. Names of the remaining AFSCME Correctional Functional Units including the Transport Unit will be placed into a ‘hat’. The two \(2\) voting panel members will alternatively draw names out of the ‘hat’. To designate the labor voting representatives, there will be three \(3\) names drawn. The President of the Functional Units drawn will be assigned to serve as voting members on the panel. Should the President be unavailable then the Vice President shall serve. The Functional Unit names will be reinserted into the ‘hat’ and two \(2\) names will be alternatively drawn to serve as the designated Management voting representatives. The Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent of Security \(or Security Manager\) or Operations Captain will be assigned to serve as the additional Management voting members of the panel.

ISDS Coordinators, Oregon AFSCME Council 75 Staff Representative and Department of Corrections Labor Relations will serve as non-voting members or resources to the panel to assist in ensuring that panel members have sufficient data and understand the relevant language in the Agreement. The purpose of the panel is to evaluate questions and circumstances in order to determine the correct job bidding seniority for a specific employee and ensure consistent application of the seniority definition in the Agreement. Any panel decision shall be final and binding on all Parties.

Neither the Employer nor the Agency will be liable for any travel expenses for any Union panel members who must travel for any panel meetings. In addition, neither the Employer nor the Agency will be liable for any overtime costs as result of the Union’s panel members attending panel meetings including travel time. The Agency shall not change an employee’s shift/days off so the employee can participate in the panel. Where feasible, the Parties can agree to use Skype or telephone conference calls when the panel meets.
