### IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW CLASSIFICATIONS APPEALS PROCESS

### Section A:

An appeal may be filed by an individual employee or a Union Council Representative on behalf of the employee, to the Agency’s Human Resource Office within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of written notification by the Agency of placement into the new classification. Employees sharing the same or substantially similar position descriptions or employees the Agency agrees to treat as a group may file an appeal as a group. The initial filing should describe the individual or group, including the names of affected employees, identify the proposed placement, and the placement believed to be correct by the affected employees. The appeal must include current signed position descriptions. Because the old classifications are to be abolished, correct placement cannot be back to the prior classification.

The agency shall conduct a review of the allocation using the following criteria:

1. The purpose of the position shall be determined by the statement of purpose and assigned duties of the position description and other relevant evidence of duties assigned by the Agency.
2. The concept of the proposed classification shall be determined by the general description and distinguishing features of its class specifications, and,
3. The overall duties, authority and responsibilities of the position shall be determined by the position description and other relevant evidence of duties assigned by the Agency. This decision shall be made within thirty \(30\) calendar days of receipt of the appeal and provided to the affected employees in writing and with a summary of the classification analysis.

### Section B:

If denied, the Union may appeal the Agency’s decision in writing to the Department of Administrative Services Labor Relations Unit within fifteen \(15\) calendar days of receipt of the written denial. The appeal will be considered by the Employer designee \(or an alternate\) and the Union designee \(or an alternate\) who shall form the committee changed with the responsibility to consider appeals and make decisions which maintain the integrity of the classification system by correctly applying the classification specifications. Additionally, the committee may utilize two resource persons, one designated by each party, to provide technical expertise concerning a specific series. The committee will attempt to resolve the matter jointly determining whether the current or proposed classification more accurately depicts the overall assigned duties, authorities and responsibilities of the position using the criteria specified above.

In this process each of the designee\(s\) may identify one alternate classification that he/she determines most accurately depicts the purpose of the position and overall assigned duties. If an alternate classification is identified, both the Union and Labor Relations Unit shall be notified. If the Parties concur that shall end the allocation appeal. In the v\event the committee concludes that the proposed or alternate classification is more appropriate, the Agency retains the right to modify the work assignment on a timely basis to make it consistent with the Agency’s allocation.

Appeals shall be decided in order of receipt by the Labor Relations Unit.

Decisions shall be rendered by the designees no later than sixty \(60\) calendar days of receipt of the appeal by the committee.

### Section C:

The decision of the designees shall be binding on the Parties. However, the Agency may elect to remove/modify duties at any point during the process.

### Section D:

If the appeals committee cannot make a decision, the Union may request final and binding arbitration by a written notice to the Labor Relations Unit within the next forty five \(45\) calendar day period. Each party may go forward with only one \(1\) classification. Each party may choose to take to arbitration either the current classification, class appealed to, or an alternate classification identified by a committee member. The arbitrator shall allow the decision of the Agency to stand unless he/she concludes that the proposed classification more accurately depicts the overall assigned duties, authority and responsibilities of the position.

### Section E:

Where a position is vacated after the filing of the initial appeal, the Union may continue the appeal process and such appeals will be reviewed by the committee only after the review of all filled positions appeals is completed and where the Agency indicates that no change in duties is anticipated prior to refilling the position.

### Section F:

This process terminates upon completion of the allocation process.
